	<description>For v1.2+

Changes the size of nearly any core work station and building to a 1x1.
(Mods not supported because I'm lazy...)

"Time to save on space"

This mod does this using the "patch" system to change/overwrite just the sizes of work stations.
That's about it.

Other changes:
Interaction cell/ghost chair able to overlap other such interaction cells (See image)
Pawns/Colonists no longer slowed down when passing "through" a workstation.

See the Example images to get a better understanding of this.

This does NOT alter work speeds or anything of the sort.
Just size of the building/station.

Made this mod because I could not find a mod doing this.
And while not strapped for space, I'm sure there is a lot of you out there
who would enjoy a mod that gave you more room, by decreasing space-usage.

Hope you'll enjoy this rather simple mod.
