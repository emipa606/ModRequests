	<description>New Setting - Stack by Ingredient:

Enable this setting to keep meals separated by ingredient, increasing the number of food choices available to pawns and helping them find more varied meals. This setting is recommended for anyone who doesn't mind needing a larger freezer. This setting has not been tested with any storage mods. 

New Setting - Count All Meals:
	
When enabled, the "do until you have x" option for cooking bills will count all cooked meals (simple, fine, lavish, but not packaged survival). Meals from mods will be included, depending how the meal was defined.
	
Bonus feature - Everywhere means Everywhere:

When cooking meals, the "look everywhere" option ordinarily only looks in stockpiles. With this mod, everywhere now means everywhere.
	
Balance Tweaks:

Providing the expected variety is now more likley to result in neutral variety, especially with the stack by ingredient setting. If you think further changes are necessary, please post in the discussion thread on the steam workshop page.</description>
