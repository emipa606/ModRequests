    <label>Mechanitor Ship</label>
    <description>A ship built using ancient mechanitor technology. Serves as a vehicle between the surface and orbit, as well as between the moons of the planetary system.
By recreating the technological solutions of the ancient civilization of mechanitors, the ship has a very high carrying capacity, decent speed, allows you to visit quite remote places, but consumes decent fuel, which is compensated by a capacious tank.
