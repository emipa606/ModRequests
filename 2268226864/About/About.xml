	<description>Ever find it odd that so few people out in the Rim have figured out even the simplest of prosthetics? Ever think pirates and raiders would try to enhance their army with bionics just like you? Ever ponder why your colonists never start with so much as an artificial heart from their life before crashing landing?
	
So did we! Now, almost every pawn from every faction on your Rimworld has an increased chance of spawning with a tech-level appropriate prosthetic limb, implant, or bionic body part, ranging from peg legs to power claws. 
	
No longer does your colony hold the monopoly on bionics!</description>
