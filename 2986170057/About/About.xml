    <description>Version 1.3 - Improve mouse drag event blocking behavior, block layout events from blocked drag events to reduce lag while expanding areas.\n\nFixes lag from mouse dragging (hold + move) mostly reported by Linux RimWorld players (do not use this mod for Windows, assume it breaks something). Bug and incompatibility reports are extremely appreciated.\n\nThe issue is that Unity calls RimWorld's GUI to update whenever the mouse (or touchpad) reports a new position while dragging, thus mouses that report their movement more often thus cause more events, more redraws and thus more lag. This fix is to patch RimWorld's Root GUI to update only from one of the mouse drag event for every mouse-down or redraw event.\n\nThis is a band-aid fix and the issue cannot be fully fixed on RimWorld's side as Unity offers no control over the event system, and my attempts to jerry-rig control break the base Unity GUI because of its assumptions about the event system.</description>
