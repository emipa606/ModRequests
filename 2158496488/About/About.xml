A simple mod that sets the volume of the comms console trading sound to zero because it's giving me a headache. I couldn't find an up to date mod for version 1.1 so I made my own.

PSA: My Rimworld modding skills are fairly limited - I really just copied the structure of the similar mod "No Digging Sounds" by K_II and adapted it to mute the comms console.
