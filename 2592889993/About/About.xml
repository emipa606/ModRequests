Restores the fishing cooking recipes removed from the RF Fishing Rework mod. While I appreciate the sushi update, a whole new table, crops, etc. is a little more than I feel like dealing with.

4 recipes:
Sushi (Cooking:6) +7 mood bonus
Boiled Shellfish (Cooking:3) +5 mood bonus
Escargot (Cooking:3) +5 mood bonus
Shrimp Scampi (Cooking:3) +5 mood bonus


(All meals were +7 mood in the original mod)
Updated Sushi meal texture (was the same as Boiled Shellfish)


Requires [RF] Fishing-ReWork


Big thanks to Rainbeau Flambe, Mlie, and Si-Cafe!
