		<description>Serving as our demolitions experts, the Grenadiers provide heavy ordnance delivery whenever and wherever we need it.

As their name suggests, Grenadiers have access to a unique grenade-only equipment slot that stacks with any other utility items the operative might be carrying: this is not just limited to frag grenades, but can be filled with any one of the specialized grenades XCOM can develop.

The Grenadier class is equipped with a minigun-style cannon and a grenade launcher, being able to choose to specialize in demolitions, focus more on making the most of their cannon or go for a combination of the two.</description>
