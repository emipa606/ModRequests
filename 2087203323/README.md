Rimworld Snowshoes Mod

This mod adds snowshoes to travel faster on snow, crampons to travel faster on ice and spiked snowshoes for both.
It also reworks how path cost it's calculated when dealing with snow.

Original:
- Pathcost Terrain
- If items on tile have bigger pathcost, this is the new pathcost
- If snow on tile has bigges pathcost, this is the new pathcost

Reworked:
- If snow it's medium or thick, ignore terrain and use snow pathcost
- Otherwise get the biggest pathcost between terrain and snow
- If items on tile have bigger pathcost, this is the new pathcost
	
Requires Harmony
