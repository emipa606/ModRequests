  <description>I'm sure you're tired of looking for mods that add new tracks, only for them to hardly fit among the vanilla ones. Even if they are great songs of their own right, you just can't play with that dissonance. I feel the same way, this is my attempt at rectifying that. I love Alistair's style, he did a wonderful job with the OST and it's a shame so many music mods diverge from his iconic sound so much.

NOTE: For some reason the Music Manager bugs out when you skim to different points of a track added by this mod. Dunno why that's the case but keep that in mind if you're using it (it isn't required).
