Easy Extra Apparel Layers
This mod makes worn apparel render in acending order of the apparels last ApparelLayerDef's drawOrder.
Higher order layers will be drawn above/ontop of lower ordered layers.

Now supports rendering over Shell
Now supports rendering over Overhead

No content is included in this mod, other than several Apparel layer defs, and a commented out example apparel thingdef.

Note that while i havent seen it in testing, it is possible, due to the way rims pawn rendering works that you may experience flickering or clipping when a pawn is wearing Alot of apparel because the way this mod works is reducing the space between the layers being drawn

Currently Incompatible with:
Combat Extended (transpilers conflicting, causing no apparel to be rendered)
