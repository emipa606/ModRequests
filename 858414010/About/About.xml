  <description>Weapons and machines from far away in the galaxy.
  
  This mod started as a simple test in the Rimworld Discord modding section but then evolved into its own little mod after we discovered it could actually add something new to the game. Weapons and machines will try their best to be balanced with vanilla gameplay.</description>
