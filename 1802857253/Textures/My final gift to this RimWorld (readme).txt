I've included the .pdn (layered) files for the images that I made myself for you to edit to your liking. Do as you wish with the contents of this file, I don't really care.

The files with layered images will be inside folders. Some might not have layered versions depending on how easy/hard it was to make the file.

To edit the layered file, you'll have to download paint.net (www.getpaint.net) OR use a program that can parse (edit/read) .pdn files.

Best of luck to the aspiring modder who gained inspiration from this mod.
