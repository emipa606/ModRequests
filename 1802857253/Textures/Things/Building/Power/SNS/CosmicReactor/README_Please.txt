This was incredibly fun to create. (Draw?)

I'm almost reluctant to leave the .pdn (layered) file in here, but I'm not that evil.

Do what you want with the file. Use it in your own mod, set it as your desktop paper, print it out and throw it in a fire, I don't care!

...though, i would appreciate a quick "hey explodoboy made the following images" if you DO happen to use my painstakingly made images.


...Or you can yell at me for it not being in the artstyle of RimWorld and I'm a horrible person in general. Your choice.
