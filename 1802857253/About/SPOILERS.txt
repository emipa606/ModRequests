If you're stuck (or curious on how to get further in the mod) then you're in the right place!

If not... Then maybe you should close this file.


To unlock Beyond Our Understanding (research)
* Obtain a TechProf Subpersona Core
* Begin researching Beyond Our Understanding
* With a Pawn (colonist), interact (right click and use) with the TechProf core.
* Doing this should instantly unlock the research.


The 5 researches after Beyond Our Understanding do nothing!
* That's intentional. Just research through them and unlock the final research. Let the spiral into madness consume you--or just use more TechProf Subpersona Cores to blitz straight through. Your choice!


How do I get the Eternity Cell? (item unlocked by final research)
* Once you've completed the Pinnacle of Creation research, look for the "Make Enigmatic Blueprint" bill in the COSMIC FORGE. It's gonna cost a TON to make the item, but it WILL be worth it. Oh so worth it...
