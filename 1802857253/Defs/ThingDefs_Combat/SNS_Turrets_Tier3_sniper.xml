	Planned turrets (concepts):
	
	(GEN1) Light Stellar Turret: A portable turret that shoots like a stellar Rifle. It has a short cooldown period and requires refurbishment.
	(GEN1) Perdition Light Stellar Turret: A portable turret that shoots slower than a stellar Rifle, but doesn't have a cooldown period. It requires refurbishment.
	
	(GEN2) Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle combined with a Minigun. It has a short cooldown period and requires occasional refurbishment. 
	(GEN2) Perdition Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle. Slower than the Cosmic Turret but no cooldown period and requires occasional refurbishment.
	(GEN2.5) Eternal Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle combined with a Minigun. It has a short cooldown period. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	(GEN2.5) Eternal Perdition Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle. Slower than the Cosmic Turret but no cooldown period. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	
	(GEN1) Catalyst Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots Cosmic Sniper rounds at a good rate. It shoots 1 bullet and then has a short cooldown. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	(GEN2) Overdrive Catalyst Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that rapidly shoots Cosmic Sniper rounds. It shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires constant Cosmic Catalyst Cell refueling. (1 Cat. Cell per shot)
	
	(GEN2) Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds. It has a (relatively) long cooldown and only shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Cosmic Catalyst Cells (5 eaten per shot) to work.
	(GEN2) Deep Storage Automated Lance: An Automated Lance with 500 CC Cell capacity.
	(GEN2) Perdition Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds relatively quickly. It shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Cosmic Catalyst Cells (5 eaten per shot) and Cosmic Matter (50 eaten per shot) as coolant. //This gets expensive real quick, but will probably be absurdly powerful against pretty much everything.
	(GEN2) Deep Storage Perdition Automated Lance: A Perdition Automated Lance with 500 CC cell capacity and 5000 CM capacity.
	(GEN2.5) Eternal Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds. It does NOT require fuel.
	
	(GEN2.9) Engimatic Lance: A non-portable 3x3 Eternium-fueled 4x4 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds quickly. It requires Eternium (1:1) as fuel.
	
	(GEN3) Automated EXARCH: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds. It shoots quickly and shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Eternium (1 per 5 shots) as fuel.
	(GEN3.5) Eternal Automated EXARCH: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds. It does not require any fuel.
	
	(GEN4) Bastion of Stability: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds like a minigun, said rounds also explode. It does not have any specific cooldown period.

	<label>catalyst turret</label>
	<description>An automatic turret fueled by the natural runoff energy of Cosmic Catalyst Cells, said cells protected by extremely thick plates of Cosmic Alloy to ensure that it cannot explode even when punctured. Incredibly safe (disclaimer 1: to the owner, not the enemy) (disclaimer 2: absolutely not safe if something destroys the CC cells after building is destroyed) overall, it can be deployed and forgotten about since it will never break down or need to be reloaded. The only downside is its slow firerate and low accuracy at very close ranges.\n\nThe turret is unique in that it its playform is tall, making it impossible to climb onto the platform and move past it.\n\nNOTE: If something destroys the turret AND Catalyst Cell fuel in one go, then a massive explosion is likely to follow unless it's contained in a very strong-walled room.\nSeriously, the cell can kill a CHARON suit user with just 3 tiles occupied and you won't like that. (either full stack or a single item--beware of spreading it over a large area in a massive vault)</description>

	<description>An automatic turret fueled by the extreme power of Cosmic Catalyst Cells, said cells protected by extremely thick plates of Cosmic Alloy to ensure that it cannot explode when when punctured. The turret, instead of being passively powered by the Catalyst Cells directly use them as ammunition. This means that the turrets will occasionally have to be resupplied.\n\nThe turret can be manually targeted to either supress or focus down an area.\n\nNOTE: If something destroys the turret AND Catalyst Cell fuel in one go, then a massive explosion is likely to follow unless it's contained in a very strong-walled room.\nSeriously, the cell can kill a CHARON suit user with just 3 tiles occupied and you won't like that.
