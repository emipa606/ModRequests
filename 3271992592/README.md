# Psychic Coils!
Adds a new Subroutine to the VREA Androids!

This new Subroutine allows your androids to utilize, and be affected by, Psychic powers that normally require psychic sensitivity.

## Psychic Robots?
The 'lore' reason for the functioning of the Subroutine goes as follows: Eltex coil windings are placed within and around the androids CPU housing, by interfacing with these windings, the android can manipulate the archotech psychic field in which they stand.

However, as the coils are used, they build up chaotic stress energies just as a normal pawn would, these energies normally dissipate harmlessly back into the psychic field, however, if they build up past the saturation point of the coils, they begin to shed the energy as heat, which dramatically reduces the androids efficiency.

### Compatibility?
  Combat Extended: 99% sure yes.
  
  Vanilla Psycasts Expanded: Yes! There may be some psycasts that don't play well with androids (Not sure how Ressurect works, if they can use it or be targeted or whatnot for example)

  Some other unrelated mod: Yeah probably. So long as the unrelated mod doesn't change VREA or the base game Neural Heat system, it's compatible, and if they DO change either of those, it might still be compatible, test it and let me know.
