  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#0094ff&gt;Better Research Tabs&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    I believe you must have had a situation where there were too many research tabs on the research page due to using too many MODs.
    This mod changes Tabs to a list with a scrollbar to solve this problem once and for all.
    With this mod, you will no longer have to give up certain mods due to too many research tabs.
    At the same time, mod authors can also boldly create their own research projects without considering the issue of too many tabs.
