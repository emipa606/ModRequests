/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This addon will allow you to deconstruct your collected ship wrecks just like in 1.2 version (but with some improvements)
The experimental version of Save Our Ship 2 can be found here https://github.com/SonicTHI/SaveOurShip2Experimental/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
But be careful! Use at your own risk (this is about my mod too, because it's still need some testing)! 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How to use:

1. Download experimental version of SoS2
2. Launch your ship in space
3. Build salvage bay
4. Go to "ship" tab in your menu.
5. Make self-destrucive deconstruction area for your wreck
6. Deconstruction process will start automaticly

BE CAREFULL!!! You can deconstruct your own ship!

A little remark: Salvage bays deconstruction bots deconstruct only ship parts, and nothing else...

P.S. I am not sure how good this thing will work with standart SoS2 mod, because I don't test it.
You can launch it with standart SoS2 mod, but this could break your saves, so make backup...

And yes... That's a bug, because after exiting the game, wreck area, can't be saved (sorry)...
