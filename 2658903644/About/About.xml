 In Rimworld, pawns seem to miss entirely too often with ranged weapons, even with high shooting skills. If you agree, but don't want to overhaul how combat works too much like Combat Extended or Yayo's Combat, then maybe this mod is for you!
  
 This mod makes one change to how one value is calculated, should be compatible with virtually everything besides combat overhaul mods (but who knows, might work with them too, I wouldn't recommend it though).
  
 On a technical level, this is a Harmony Postfix to ShotReport.AimOnTargetChance_IgnoringPosture to double the result. This seemed to have the desired action in tweaking combat hit chances the way and amount I wanted after tinkering with this and other variables and testing some things.
