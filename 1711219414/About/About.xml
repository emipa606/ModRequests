		Yabils are a space farring, crafty race of small humanoids known for their resourcefulness and hard-working characteristics. Many just refer to them as "space gremlins", a call back to old earth mythology given their short size and big-eared appearance. They lack physical prowess and their twitchy demanor tends to make them inaccurate shooters, so most of them try to ally themselves with stronger factions.
		
		This mod is a fork of Mister Manson's Yabils mod.
