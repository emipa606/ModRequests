	<description>Adds a new Aztec culture that combines More Religious Origins, Aztec Weapon Style Pack, and Nahuatl Tribal Names.
	
There are so many cool style packs, namers, and ideology structures out there, but it always bothered me that I either couldn't combine them or it required a lot of playing around with settings. Well, I decided to do something for that.
	
I made a new Aztec culture that automatically adds the Aztec style categories from More Religious Origins and Aztec Weapon Style Pack, and applies pawn, deity, leader titles, etc. I also added three Aztec factions, civil, rough, and hostile, which utilize this culture. If you have Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures, then they will use memes from that mod (Civil uses the Trader meme, Rough uses the God Emperor and Craft Culture memes, and Hostile uses the Violent Conversion meme).

These new options can obviously be ignored by just getting rid of the Aztec factions on world generation if you don't want them. They are pretty much just the tribal factions with the Aztec ideology.</description>
