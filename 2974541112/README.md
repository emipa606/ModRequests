## The Pit
Just a deep hole in the ground. Only for prisoners.

- Requires no research nor resources.

- Fits 5 prisoners in 2x2 space

## Cabin
High density housing with integrated temperature controls.

- Some research and resources required.
- Soundproof
- Has climate controls
- Has some comfort
- Movable
- Pawns can eat inside
- Can be assigned to prisoners, but needs extra outside walls or high fences to contain them.
- Fits 10 pawns in 4x2 space

## TSS (Test Subject Storage)
Pawns are stored in the individual capsules, in a conveyor-like rotating facility.
Their basic needs are satisfied, but don't expect them to be happy while inside the TSS.
The space is tight and forced sleep causes nightmares.
Warranty void if kept without power for more than 2 hours.
