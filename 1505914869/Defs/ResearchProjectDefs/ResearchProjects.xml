	<description>Gives access to the hacking table and the mechanoid platform. The hacking table can be used to hack into the targeting system of mechanoids, making sure they attack your enemy instead of your colony when activated. Also allows you to build mechanoid platforms, which are needed as a repair and as a power station for mechanoids.</description>

		<description>Upgrade module that aims to increase the speed of mechanoids at the cost of moderately increased power consumption. Mechanoids are designed to run with a limited reactor capacity. Their locomotion system is designed to run at a certain capped speed to be energy efficient. With some hacking and additional hardware, this speed can be increased above design specifications without causing any damage to the hardware. The procedure does result in higher power consumption.</description>

		<description>An upgrade module that aims to improve the sight of mechanoids. It drains a small amount of power. Mechanoid sensor technology is more advanced than the current state-of-the-art human sensor technology. However, the sensors installed in mechanoids roaming the planet are hundreds of years old. It is impressive that these sensors still function after ages of wearing, but their quality does decay over time. Despite them being inferior, adding human-made sensors can still improve the mechanoid's sight.</description>

This activates the mechanites, repairing damage by consuming the parts while temporarily slowing the mechanoid.</description>

To get a consciousness, it requires access to the knowledge found in mechanoid hive ships. With a consciousness, it can become a powerful but dangerous cyberweapon with an unquenchable thirst for more data. 
Without a consciousness, it still provides a small boost to the resource efficiency and repair speed of surrounding mechanoid platforms, as it can manage mechanites to cooperate in a more organised manner.</description>
