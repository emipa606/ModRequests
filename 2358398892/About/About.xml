  Added new building - Anima Tree Spot. It's drawing ornament on ground which strangely attracts Anima tree. This building should be placed on ground without roof even if there are another buildings nearest. Then need to chop tree if it exist. After time new Anima Tree will appear in this spot. Note if there are buildings nearby potential of the tree will be lowered.
  And there are new reskin of course.
