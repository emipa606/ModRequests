  <description>Ever wonder why your Intellectual pawns who have researched the secrests of the universe, or the crafters of your colonies who have created artifacts of such quality that news spreads across the lands, cant seem to craft bionic equipment that has above standard efficiency?
	well now you dont have to wonder! Introducing quality bionics! Stronger bionics for smarter people.
	Prostheses at bionic level and above now have quality levels that affect the efficiency of the part. because lets face it, someone had to have figured out a way to make a circuit in the unit a little bit better.
