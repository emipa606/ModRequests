  <description> Some plants and gardening type stuff. Adds various wild and cultivated plants, garden paths, outdoors lighting, a light column, and some raised planter beds. It also patches vanilla berry bushes, roses, daylilies and clivias to use random textures.\nLifespan and growing time patches have been removed, since the vanilla plant spawner has been much improved.</description>
