<description>This a HD update of the original Roo’s Dreadlock Hairstyles Mod, with each hairstyle having been redesigned and scaled to a higher resolution (512 x 512). The hair in this pack comes in a wide range of textures, lengths and styles and the mod also includes a ‘Dreadlocks only’ gene for Biotech players. This mod can also be used alongside both the legacy and lite versions.

A gracious thank you to everyone who made this mod possible!
