[b]Buildable soil, grass tiles. Buildable plants and trees. Used for decoration.[/b]

[h2]About[/h2]
All decorations are made using wood, cloth and chemfuel. That makes them highly flammable.

[h3]Decorative tiles[/h3]
Soil - Base game soil
Grass - From Greenworld Grass(with adjustments)

Tiles come in soft and hard edge variants. Being fake, they have no fertility.

[h3]Decorative trees and plants[/h3]
This mod is special in that it generates fake plants from the plants in the game. Fake plant uses same code for rendering as real plants, so they wave in the wind.
Their types, sizes and graphics is taken from proper plants. So it should create fake plants from mods or ones that change graphics.
Each plant and tree has multiple variants based on how big it can grow and if it can have multiple plants on same tile.
As long as this mod is placed after all mods that change plants.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

This mod should be compatible with any mod that adds or changes plants or trees. As long as the mod doesn't do anything weird.
Just make sure this mod is placed after all other mods that change plants.

[h2]Issues[/h2]

The build designator does not show how the plant will look once it is build. This is because of special rendering being done after the plant was built. As I don't consider this major issue, I don't plan on fixing it.
