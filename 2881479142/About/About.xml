  <description>In vanilla, gene inheritance between pawns of different xenotypes for genes which have a metabolism cost is inconsistent. The mod makes it more consistent.

When a pawn is impregnated by a partner of a different xenotype, their offspring is assigned a maximum metabolism value based on the following logic: 70% chance for 1, 20% chance for 2, 10% chance for 3. A pawn with maximum metabolism of 1 will not be able to inherit any genes that would push their total metabolism outside of the range { -1, 1 }.

Worse still, this mechanic is calculated one gene at a time. If a pawn is created with a maximum metabolic rating of 3 and the first gene it inherits is a 3 metabolism gene then it won't be able to inherit any more genes with a metabolism cost unless it first inherits one with a negative metabolism cost. This means that the likelihood to inherit genes is not only based on the cost of the gene but the order in which the genes are present on the pawn.

This mod removes the maximum metabolism value entirely so that inheritance works consistently all the time: 50% chance per gene for each parent, like in vanilla.</description>
