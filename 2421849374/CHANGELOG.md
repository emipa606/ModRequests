# 3.0

This update completely overhauls the hunger boost to use hediffs rather than a straight, and invisible, damage buff.

As part of this change, the Golden Shower now offers an escalating set of bonuses to the weapon's damage and cooldown time based on the user's hunger, but at the expense of making the user hungry faster.

# 2.0

- Updated to support RimWorld 1.3

# 1.2

Further balance changes based on more extensive playtesting:

- Lowered mass slightly more
- Slightly improved range
- Reduced base damage slightly (but still higher than 1.0)
- Reverted the hunger boost threshold to 40%

# 1.1

Made some balance changes in response to feedback:

- Increased the base damage and armour penetration
- Increased the base accuracy
- Slightly lowered the move speed penalty and mass
- The hunger boost now triggers below 60% food (up from 40%). However, the maximum damage boost has been reduced from 110% to 100% at 0 hunger to account for the base gun being more powerful.

# 1.0

Initial release.
