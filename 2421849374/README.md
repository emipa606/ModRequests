# Fat Larry's Golden Shower

A big gun for a big man.

Cast from quantities of gold no normal person could obtain legally on the Rim, this extravagant monster is effectively several charge rifles strapped together.

The bullets are all individually cast from a plastigold alloy nicknamed "Golden Jorisite," and infused with an eldritch power which boosts the weapon's power if the owner is hungry.

Created as thanks to Mr Samuel Streamer for all the warcrimes and laughter. Concept inspired by SoldierGG1's incredible Fat Larry fanart.
