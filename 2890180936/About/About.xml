<description>This mod adds a new category of natural tattoos with a more common spawn rate than standard tattoos. Pawns with birthmarks or blemishes won't undergo any changes to their beauty or stats. These tattoos are entirely cosmetic.

Rare blemishes such as vitiligo or chin dimples won't appear often. But features like moles and small birthmarks will. Like all tattoos, blemishes can be removed or applied at a styling station.
