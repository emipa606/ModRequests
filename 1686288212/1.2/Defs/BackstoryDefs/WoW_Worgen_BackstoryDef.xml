However [PAWN_nameDef] refused to muck out the stables, instead bribing other children to do it in return for favours [PAWN_pronoun] may or may not have followed up on.</baseDescription>

After the war the militia was redirected to defend the Greymane Wall when it was built and as such was one of the first to be turned by the worgen after they were summoned.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>Despite what outsiders may have thought of [PAWN_nameDef]'s homeland Gilneas was good grounds for mountain horses. [PAWN_nameDef] regularly wrangled the horses, having to take great care around the local ettin looking to eat them, and trained them for use as mounts and pulling carriages. To this day people are furious that the favoured mount of Gilneas is yet another horse and not some funky wolf-like boar creature, something [PAWN_nameDef] really doesn't understand.</baseDescription>

And yet, [PAWN_nameDef] was one of the first able to control the transformation between worgen and human. No one knows when or how [PAWN_nameDef] Turned as [PAWN_pronoun] never seems to realise what happened. That or [PAWN_pronoun] is very good at hiding things.</baseDescription>

[PAWN_nameDef] was one such watchman, patrolling the city for signs of robbers and burglary. Even those with high social status weren't free from [PAWN_possessive] keen eyes and [PAWN_pronoun] gave warning to many lords and ladies by claiming 'it is impossible to distinguish a lord from another man by the outside of a coach, especially at unreasonable times'.

However [PAWN_nameDef] greatly opposed the king's tactic to flee and hide from the encroaching worgen and was one of the first to take up arms against the beasts. Ultimately [PAWN_pronoun] failed but has since decided that being a worgen isn't quite so bad after all.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>The original recipe for the cure that allowed worgen to retain their sanity was lost during the fall of Gilneas. [PAWN_nameDef] has taken charge of remaking this recipe before something dreadful happens, though no one yet shows sign of falling back into mindless rage. The only problem is figuring out the ingredients. All [PAWN_pronoun] knows is that mandrake essence was involved and so [PAWN_pronoun] spends much of [PAWN_possessive] time experimenting with various herbs.
