There the naaru K'ure granted them a chance to leave via the inter-dimensional ship Genedar and the refugees renamed themselves the draenei, the "exiled ones".</baseDesc>

Granted, [PAWN_nameDef] has been doing this ever since the naaru first revealed themselves. Regardless, [PAWN_pronoun] continues to do so. Even if [PAWN_nameDef] never joins the Army of the Light [PAWN_pronoun] has proven to be an efficient soldier.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_nameDef] left alone, was quickly put on an orphanage with many others, but considering the situation the draenei were in, they received just a basic education, and each one of them made their own path on Azeroth.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_pronoun] then ensured that several herds of talbuk were brought aboard the Genedar during their flight from Argus and watched as they made a home for themselves on Draenor.

		<baseDesc>It is unclear what the true purpose of a draenei vindicator is, with many believing it to be the draenic version of the paladin. Despite this many vindicators do not, or choose not to, use Light magic and some have even been named "dark vindicators", going completely against these assumptions. Others have since likened the term to be more similar to a courtroom judge. Whatever the real meaning behind the title may be, [PAWN_nameDef] is very familiar with both words and weaponry. Best tread lightly around [PAWN_pronoun].</baseDesc>
