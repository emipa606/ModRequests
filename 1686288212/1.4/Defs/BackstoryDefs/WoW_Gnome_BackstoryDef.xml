		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] loves animals more than anything. However, [PAWN_pronoun] hates dealing with animals more than anything. So much fur or feathers. And the mess! So [PAWN_nameDef] set about recreating common creatures in a new, metallic and far easier to manage form. [PAWN_possessive] first achievement was, as with most gnomes, a robot chicken. But [PAWN_pronoun] treasures that chicken.</baseDesc>

		<titleShort>Refugee</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>Just about every gnome that survived the irradiation caused by an explosion set off deep within Gnomeregan became contaminated. Those who did not receive immediate cleansing devolved into leper gnomes. Originally a humble Gnomeregan citizen [PAWN_nameDef] turned to the assistance of fabricating weaponry for the Alliance from within the Tinker Town district of Ironforge.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>Gnomes favour a master-servant hierarchy wherein the master supplies the servant and not the servant waiting on their master. [PAWN_nameDef] had a particularly generous master, more often than not being given more tools and parts than [PAWN_pronoun] knew what to do with. So what better use than to shove them all together and see what happens? Watching things go out of control and tear themselves apart is the best way to learn together!</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>After fleeing the irradiated city of Gnomeregan [PAWN_nameDef] didn't fancy twiddling [PAWN_possessive] thumbs until inspiration struck. So [PAWN_pronoun] tried [PAWN_possessive] hand at helping in the dwarven kitchens in Ironforge. It worked out for a while but always felt slow and like something was missing. So [PAWN_nameDef] invented a machine that would distribute the ingredients for them. [PAWN_pronoun] though it was genius. The dwarves didn't agree.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] began digging around the Gnomelands after hearing stories of being descended from mechagnomes who'd become cursed to be the fleshy creatures gnomes are today. [PAWN_nameDef] likes to think that [PAWN_pronoun] is very effective at finding remnants of their mechanical ancestors buried in the snow and rock. No one had the heart to tell [PAWN_objective] that the scraps were the remains of a failed defence droid that exploded last week.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>After they made a temporary home in Ironforge alongside the dwarves many gnomes started picking up dwarfish quirks and interests. [PAWN_nameDef] found a keen interest in brewing beer and ale using [PAWN_possessive] engineering skills, supplying the local inns with various beverages. Most notably among [PAWN_possessive] recipes is Gnomenbrau, 'a light beer with a big head'.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>Not all gnomes are fixated on technology and machinery. After spending time with the more fight-focused dwarves and helping out in various places around Azeroth [PAWN_nameDef] became fascinated with melee combat. At some point [PAWN_pronoun] set up [PAWN_possessive] own Brawlpub where battle-hungry fighters sign up to fight against a curious assortment of opponents.

		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] once piloted a flying machine of [PAWN_possessive] own design. It worked fantastically and [PAWN_pronoun] loved flying around shooting stuff. [PAWN_pronoun] got fairly good at it, then a yeti managed to get a hold of one of the runners and sent the machine careening all the way back to Ironforge. [PAWN_nameDef] still makes flying machines and still shoots stuff, but it'll take a lot to get [PAWN_objective] back in the seat.</baseDesc>

		<title>Mechanostrider Manufacturer</title>
		<titleShort>Manufacturer</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] used to run a facility that produced mechanostriders, avian-like robots to be used as mounts. They were originally designed by High Tinker Mekkatorque after being inspired by a flock of tallstriders, hence why they look like birds. [PAWN_nameDef] liked this, believing they could be used as practice for interacting with the flesh-and-blood creatures. Except robots could be reprogrammed while animals did as they pleased. Maybe not then.</baseDesc>

From remote-controlled zeppelins to battlebots that seek out other bots to fight, [PAWN_nameDef]'s imaginative ideas are endless. [PAWN_pronoun] was most well known for [PAWN_possessive] toy train and the infuriating sounds it made.
