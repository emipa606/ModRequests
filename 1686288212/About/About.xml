	<description>Rimcraft, a fantasy mod based upon World of Warcraft.

Feature Overview
  -  Blood Elves, Night Elves, Orcs, Azerothian Humans, High Elves, Trolls, Forsaken Humans/Elves, Draenei, Worgen, Tauren, and Dwarves.
  -  Each race has its own respective advantages and disadvantages.
  -  Lore based backstories and names for each race.

This mod on it's own does nothing. Check out the top of the list of Rimcraft suggested mods to see all of the other mods that give functionality in-game.

Rimcraft is very much a work in progress, with the intent to add more custom races, armor, weapons, and everything fitting within the Warcraft universe. Constructive criticism, suggestions, and ideas are very much appreciated.

Currently looking for help regarding lore information/backstories or any form of help people are able to help with. Contributions to the project are always appreciated.

For more information or if you're interested in helping with the project, feel free to check out our discord if you have a personal question for me about the mod, or post pictures related to the mod. https://discord.gg/3Dp7Zug

Specific race change values listed here, values on the left hand side are default vanilla human values. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MrG2TJ-qC3HCUQsieB-Lm6vZK2D32Si1tvnuCozI1Xk/edit#gid=248905997
Keep in mind not all races listed are necessarily implemented in-game.
