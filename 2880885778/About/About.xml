Godlike power in a single gene

Have you ever wanted to curbstomp a god? With this kind of gene-power, you finally can!

Let me know if there are any problems, or lines you'd like me to add, since this mod is entirely about being ridiculously overpowered.

If you want the values to be lower, higher, or gone, open it up in notepad and change them as you will.

This is a pretty simple file i threw together on notepad in a binge of ADHD related hyper-focus over the course of a few hours, but it seems to work.
