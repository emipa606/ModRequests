  Version: 1.4.0.1
        
Hey there!
        
Project Armoury 20th century pack adds 288 weapon designs from the later half of 20th century to rimworld(1945-2000), which are extensively balanced using linear mathematical conversion and approximation formulas,this mod aims to add a lot of variety while remaining  vanilla balance-friendly, as well as lore-friendly. Each weapon design has a short description of it's origins. This mod has been a long time in the making, and if you see any bugs be it duplicated descriptions or weapon being utterly unbalanced please do report!
