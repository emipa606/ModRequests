	<description> Adds three medieval-tech shells to be used in conjunction with the SRTS Medieval Expanded Tweaks and Translation military dirigible.
	Technically can also be used with a mortar. They require a new research "Medieval Shelling" and are craftable at the Stonecutter Bench. They are a little more
	labor-intensive than vanilla shells and weigh quite a bit more, but are roughly as effective. This is my first mod with original artwork.
	
	Eventually I would like to patch this mod to add the Gunpowder research prerequisite from Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval, and to make them launchable from
	the Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security catapult, but I wanted to release the mod now so that medieval pilots have RP-appropriate bombs to drop on their neighbors.
