	<description>In the absence of the original Author I've updated the mod to 1.4   
	
Recommeneded to be used with the mod "Dress Patients" so you can disable visitors or prisoners ability to escape.
	
Original Description: Got tired of my prisoners and I don't really wanna chop their legs off so I made a mod to just simply bind their legs together, among other things.
