    <description>This is a simple addition of a new joy item, Radio.
The radio has to be researched by your pawns in a new research tab.
There is very limited joy furniture, especially early game so thought of this simple radio.
Not really an exciting mod, but does its job nicely.
The radio requires power(100) and costs steel(70) and a component to build.
Pawns have to have hearing to listen to the radio, so
look after them ears.
No sound unfortunately, would probably get annoying anyway.
