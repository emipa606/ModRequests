Nguni Shield:  
Recipe: 15 x Wood, 45 x Leather  
Description: A design originating amongst the Nguni people of South Africa, this lightweight shield--traditionally made from cowhide--was most famously used by the Zulu. Designed for offensive purposes in mind, it is not thick enough to protect the user against sustained fire, but in skilled hands is extremely effective in hand-to-hand combat.

Wicker Shield:  
Recipe: 60 x Wood  
Description: Carried by the Sparabara of the armies of Ancient Persia, the shields are made of wickerwork, offering reasonably good coverage from most simple projectiles without weighing the user down. Unfortunately, their lightweight construction means they offer less protection against the thrust of a spear or sword in hand-to-hand combat.

Aspis:
Recipe: 60 x Wood, 5 x Steel
Description: A convex shield made of wood and often covered with a thin sheet of bronze or other metal.

Scutum:  
Recipe: 60 x Wood, 10 x Steel  
Description: Famously carried by Roman legionaries, its design reflected its role as a heavy infantryman's shield. Made of layers of wood glued together and covered with canvas or leather, it offered a good compromise between weight and protection. A later design, thick planks and a metal edging give the shield additional strength.

Kite Shield:  
Recipe: 70 x Wood  
Description: A cavalryman's shield, the kite shield originated in Western Europe, becoming widespread around the 10th Century AD. While one of the few designs of the time that offered good protection the users legs, its length made it awkward for infantry to use. Nevertheless, it was extremely popular, seeing extensive use throughout Europe, and evenutally being introduced to the Holy Land by Norman Crusaders.

Riot Shield:  
Recipe: 60 x Steel  
Description: Designed for law enforcement and corrections officers, this shield's lightweight metal construction and large size make it ideal for use against crowds and unarmed opponents. However, it offers only limited protection against projectiles and isn't thick enough to stop even the lowest caliber gunfire.

Assault Shield:  
Recipe: 60 x Steel, 4 x Components  
Description: An advanced composite shield with a suite of integrated sensors, the assault shield was designed for military units likely to find themselves engaged in extremely close-quarters combat. Far smaller than a full-sized ballistic shield, it trades coverage for mobility. Though capable of stopping handgun and rifle rounds, its small size leaves the user very little to hide behind should they find themselves under sustained fire.

Tactical Shield:
Recipe: 30 x Chemfuel, 70 x Leather/Textile
Description: A "soft" medium-sized ballistic shield, made from reinforced textile materials rather than metal. Though offering less ballistic protection than the assault shield, it offers wider coverage at a fraction of the weight.
