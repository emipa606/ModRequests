  <description>This mod expands medieval medical gameplay with new tools, furnishings, and infrastructure to support immersive, low-tech healing.

It introduces tincture medicine as an herbal alternative to industrial kits, healing cots and healer's stands to improve patient care without electricity, and shadowboxes for passive recreation during recovery. A polished stone floor type offers a clean, sterile-like surface for medieval hospitals, enhancing cleanliness without modern materials.

Whether you're building a humble village clinic or a full herbal healing hall, this mod gives you the means to care for your colonists with historically-inspired depth and style.</description>
