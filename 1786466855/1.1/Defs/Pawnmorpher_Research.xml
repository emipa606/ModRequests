		<description>By careful recalibration of mechanite components, we may be able to make our own mutagenic serums. This costs mechanite slurry to do, and unlocks creation of basic mechanite serums. Also unlocks a bench for working with these mutagens, as the drug lab will not be suitable for further projects.</description>

		<description>For now, serums only seem to keep the end size of the pawn roughly similar to nominal. Pursuing this path will allow the creation of serums where size can be increased, at the cost of huge hunger. It can be unstable.</description>

		<description>With a pawn skilled in crafting, it should be possible to repurpose the mutagenic mechanites into a variety of different configurations, that nullify their mutagenic effect. In this way, we will be able to create other non-mutagenic mechanite serums of our own such as healers and even resurrectors.</description>

		<description>Develop plans to construct a centrifuge to refine slurry and chaobulbs back to mutanite by a process involving the straining of mechanites through morphsilk. This process will not be efficient and will use quite a bit of power, but if mutanite is otherwise unobtainable...this is one way to get it. It will also be possible to forgo safety protocols to speed up the process, though this may have unintended effects on anyone nearby.</description>

		<description>Isolating the actual genomes of the mechanites involved allows us to create distinct strains of mutagens for specific animals. However, in order to isolate the genome a given animal, the genetic structure of said animal will need to be sequenced from live specimens and stored in a database to cross-reference it. This can be done by refitting a bolt-action rifle to fire 'tagging' rounds, to add their genetic code to a morphsilk tape-based genebank.</description>

		<description>It didn't take long to come up with this, because apparently the top scientists wanted to be able to determine exactly what came out the other end. This unlocks the modulator, which in turn allows you to pick an animal for the chamber to turn a pawn into provided they've already been tagged. You will also be able to connect two pods together via the modulator. Once two pawns are in the connected chambers, this should unlock another option...</description>
