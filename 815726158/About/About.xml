<description> Guess what, prisoners are now human beings that need recreation. Your welcome. Now updated to be more compatible with other mods, thanks to the awesome work of Ragepyre. Unless it breaks, this mod will always be up to date. Originally named "Prisoner Joy", but renamed because Joy was renamed to Recreation. Ah well.</description>
