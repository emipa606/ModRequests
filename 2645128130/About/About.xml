The first mod in the Oddities collection, a series of mods that adds a variety of rare items to your Rimworld playthrough.

Oddities: Weapons Module adds a collection of high-quality weaponry into your game. Not obtainable under normal circumstances, these weapons can only be obtained through quests and from other rare sources!
Each weapon brings their own collection of unique abilities to the table, from stealing life on hit to random effects on each shot of the gun! Turn the tides of combat with these valuable artifacts!
