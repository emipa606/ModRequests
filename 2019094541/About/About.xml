<description>Adds new inspiration types:

* Farming: increases planting speed by 200% and harvest chance by 75% (or harvest amount by 75% if you have a mod)
* Mining: increases mining speed by 200% and mining yield by 75%
* Researching: increases research speed by 200%

Because these new inspirations dilute the inspiration pool so you will get the other inspirations less often, they have a higher minimum skill requirement so that you are more likely to get them only on your main pawns that use those skills. 
The skill requirements are 8.
