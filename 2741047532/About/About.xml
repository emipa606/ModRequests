	<description>This mod adds more than ten kinds of demons from the Megami Tensei series, as well as two game protagonists.
You can tame demons to obtain various resources.
The two protagonists will appear as powerful enemies. Although they are difficult to tame, you can test your colony's combat prowess by challenging them. Once they join your colony, that's sure to be a solid fighting force.
While slaughtering demons doesn't get you meat or leather, you'll get some silver, as in RPG defeating enemies.
