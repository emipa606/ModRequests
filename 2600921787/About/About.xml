	<description>You. Yes you! Are events too spaced out for you but you wish Randy would die in a ditch? well boy do I have a storyteller for you!

"Vitu is a tiny kobold with a love for adventure and glory, and will make the story such with more major events and even more tiny events squeezed in. But will give a little time to recover. Heroes deserve a little "Me Time" afterall!"

Vitu is a rather energetic storyteller, she keep your colony busy without the absolute nightmare that is Randy Random. This mod is a W.I.P. and things are subject to change.
