	<description> Imagine. *knocks dusty bonnet of the car* This, is a miracle. Look, I've seen this thing in a book. This isn't just any car, it's THE car. You know what I mean? This car, right here, is an icon. A relic from a bygone era. 
  
  I'm telling you, this is more than just a vehicle. It's a piece of history. Imagine the stories it could tell, the adventures it's been on. And look, all the parts seem intact. With a little bit of care, we might just get it running again.</description>
