Break cooking tasks into logical sub-units.

Breaks up and modifies the Cooking work type in the following manner:
• Moves brewing task to a new work type called Brewing
• Copies the Fill Fermenting Barrel task into the Brewing Subtask¹
• Adds a work type called Butcher that commands pawns to produce meat²

1: These are not moved out of the Hauling work type so a pawn set to Hauling will also fill fermenting barrels as well.
2: These are not moved out of the Cooking work type so a pawn set to Cooking will also butcher meat as needed as well.
