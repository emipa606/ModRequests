  <Dryxsteel.description>Dryxsteel alloy. An immeasurably strong material forged through extreme heat and pressure, it fuses plasteel in a lattice-style bond that increases its strength exponentially, as well as its resistance to heat. Used in the production of space elevators, reactor casings, anti-matter shells and other volatile substances.</Dryxsteel.description>
