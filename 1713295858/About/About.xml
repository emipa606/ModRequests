Have you ever wondered why is it that we just need stone blocks or steel to build a bed, while wool and fur pile up on the warehouse, unused? Do you get a feeling it would be way more comfortable to lay down on something soft? And what if that cozy bed could also help with the freezing cold? Well, that's what this mod is all about!
Now your beds will only provide full comfort if you add some mattress, pillows and a blanket - or a bedding set, to simplify - which can be made at your regular tailor bench or crafting spot. More than that: depending on what these are made of, your beds can get even more comfortable than the regular ones, affecting their effectiveness in providing rest as well. Also, the material insulation properties carries over to the bed, helping keep your pawns warm.
But blankets, of course, can't help with the heat. For those playing on tropical climates, we included a tropical alternative to beds: hammocks! How come nobody thought of that before? These cheap hanging rigs may not be as comfortable as a full bed, but they do help cooling off. And being cheap and light, they can also be used as travel beds, just like bedrolls!
