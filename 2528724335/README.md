# Empire---Neolithic-Buildings -  [![RimWorld 1.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.3-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)](http://rimworldgame.com/)
This mod adds 15 new, neolithic-only buildings to the Empire mod. A full list of what buildings are included below. If you want to find out what each does, try it out! 
This is currently designed for early-game or low-tech play-throughs, but I would appreciate any feedback on balancing or game play.
