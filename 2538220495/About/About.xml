	<description>Wolves Den is a mod that aims to bring stronger wolves from myths and legends in the game, 
	and be viable in endgame fights.
	Hopefully over time and with more funding, i will be able to bring in a few different
	types of wolves with different niches and abilites to help your ultratech bases thrive and survive
	in those massive mechanoid raids
