Requires a mod that allows child colonists to function properly. I highly recommend Children, School, and Learning at minimum.
	
Sister mod of Wean's World - Only Generate Children, I don't recommend using both at the same time.
	
Want to crash land with some brats? Want your base raided by pirates using child soldiers? Want the man in black who saves your colony to be a kid who still believes in Saint Nick?
	
This mod adjusts the age curve of Humanlikes to allow for children to generate roughly 20% of the time. 
	
As this is an XML mod that only changes the age range, it should be compatible with just about everything. If you want to change the range, simply open WeansWorldAlt.XML and edit the limit to your liking.
	
You are free to use this mod as a base to make it compatible with other races or versions of Rimworld if you wish.
