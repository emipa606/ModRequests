Automatically scales the required population count in rituals to accomodate different sized colonies.

This will currently affect:
[list]
[*] Required participants in most rituals
[*] Drums in drum parties (only ever scaled down)
[/list]

[h1]Features[/h1]
A configurable population percentage in the mod settings controls how much of your population is necessary for rituals. Defaulting to 75%, this will allow a few colonists to miss a ritual in smaller colonies without suffering quality loss.

By default, this mod will scale down ritual participation requirements for small colonies, but leave the default cap in place. So long as you have a large enough population to support the default requirements (taking the population percentage into account), ritual behavior will be identical to vanilla.

However, there are a few options available for uncapping rituals in large colonies.

[list]
[*] Scaled: Scales up the ritual requirements in the same way they're scaled down. Larger colonies will require additional participants to maximize quality.
[*] Bonus: Once the default cap is reached, adding extra participants will confer a configurable quality bonus, with diminishing returns. Hopelessly unbalanced, but someone might find a use for it.
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This is a tiny Harmony mod that patches a few ritual outcome comps to override how they calculate attendence requirements and quality, and should be compatible with most other mods. It doesn't add anything additional to the game or your save. You should be able to freely add or remove it at any time. Mods that add custom rituals may or may not be scaled depending on whether they use some sort of custom attendance tracking.

[h1]Support[/h1]
If you find any issues that I don't notice myself or have suggestions for additional features, open up a discussion and I'll take a look as soon as I have a chance.
