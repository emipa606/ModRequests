  <TechshardDesc>This is a techshard for the research project '{PROJECT_label}'.
\nThis is a fragment of a techprint, the physical form of which can range from scraps of paper with diagrams, all the way to advanced self-contained teaching machines. They help your researchers to piece together a rough idea of the designs used in more established societies.
\nYour researchers need the foundational knowledge offered by techshards to know where to start on a given technology. Only after enough techshards have been applied can your researchers work out the fine details of how to make use of the technology in your particular situation.
\nApplying techshards to a satisfied project fulfills part of the remaining research progress.</TechshardDesc>
