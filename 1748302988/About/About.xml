V1.3 (Obsoleting)
This mod adds the ability to turn almost any corpse to fuel.

1. Produces 50 chemfuel with 1 Human or Animal corpse in refinery.
2. Does nothing else.

Should be compatible with anything. (Yes, it works with zombies and or other alien types.)

Special thanks to Animare_Cafe and CapatinSnafu

Update 6/3/19: Removed certain smaller animals due to exploitative nature. Also removed un-used code.
Update 11/26/19 Compatible with Fluffy's Mod Manager.
Update 7/21/21 Added "1.3" to notepad. As well as not updating this for future content, this was a niche I had since I'm somewhat a psychopath feel free to do with it as you may.</description>
