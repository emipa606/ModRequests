	<description>SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER ANY MOD THAT THIS PATCHES!
	
	VERSION: 3.0.1 "Here We Go Again" Edition
	
	This is an unofficial addon for AOTC that adds lots of various stuff, including more recipes for the Utopia Device and a few new Zenith biotics.
	
	Current Features (note that I've probably missed a few, I made most of this mod a long time ago):
	
	- Altered many Utopia Device recipes to boost item output (this is done by directly overriding AOTC's original files; for the record this is an awful way to do this but if you want to spend an hour writing patches and send them to me when you're done, be my guest)
	
	- Made all recipes from the Utopia Device instant
	
	- Added Utopia Device recipes for the following mods:
	RJW
	RJW - Licentia Labs
	Archotech Expanded
	Android Tiers
	VGP Vegetable Garden
	Dubs Rimatomics
	More Archotech Garbage Reupload
	Glitter Tech
	Pawnmorpher
	[1001]Rapid Aging Pills (continued)
	What the hack?!
	Aquarium (Continued)
	
	- Added custom parts for RJW (unfortunately, fertility control is not possible without custom harmony code)
	
	- Renamed Utopia Device to Utopia Engine (IMO better name)
	
	- Changed some description text of various things to fix grammatical errors and overall read better
	
	- Makes the Utopia Device consume 5M watts
	
	- Adds the Temporal Barrier Projector, a device that fits around the eyes and projects a temporal shield identical to the Cycle Alpha's, allowing you to wear normal clothes while maintaining extreme levels of protection (yes, it should satisfy a royal)
	
	- Adds the Zenith Skin Membrane, adding huge bonuses to a pawn
	
	- Makes all of the Zenith parts give a pawn extra beauty, as well as specialized bonuses depending on the part
	
	- Adds a part identical to the neural enhancer but is an implant instead of a replacement
	
	- Installing Zenith implants takes no medical skill and does not anesthetize the patient</description>
