	<description>Increases the power output of vanometric power cells with two new technologies.

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
This mod seeks to make vanometric power cells more valuable to a player after other advanced power options are available by adding two technologies that improve their power output. Since the vanometric power cells are still incredibly rare, you will still need other power sources unless you find 2+ cells.

Technologies Added:
+ Vano-Adapters (Spacer)
  - Requires Advanced Fabrication to research.
  - 4000 research point technology
  - Increases power output to 2500W.
+ Vano-Connectors (Ultra)
  - Requires Vanometric Adapters
  - 6000 research point technology 
  - Increases power output to 5000W.

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibilies&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;size=16&gt;Royalty&lt;/size&gt;
+ Technologies will require techprints to research if Royalty is present.
+ Unstable Power Cells power output increases to 800, 1200W respectively.

&lt;size=16&gt;VFE Power&lt;/size&gt;
+ Large Vanometric Power Cell output increases to 6000W and 12000W.
+ Small Vanometric Power Cell output increases to 1125W and 2250W.

&lt;size=16&gt;Archonexus Buildings Provide Power&lt;/size&gt;
+ Archonexus Core output increases to 15000W and 30000W. Wow.
+ Grand Archotech Structure output increases to 11250W and 22500W.
+ Major Archotech Structure output increases to 10000W and 20000W.
+ Archotech Tower output increases to 8750W and 17500W
