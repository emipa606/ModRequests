  <description>This mod adds a wool item and fur harvesting property for chinchilla farming.\n\nFor any version.This mod adds a wool item and fur harvesting property for chinchilla farming. \n\n I had a brief conversation on Reddit with Tynan a few years ago, after I had raised the fact that chinchillas live in deserts, not jungles as Rimworld spawned them, because rain would kill them. Tynan informed me that in the future, chinchillas are actually genetically modified to be much more resilient. I would imagine that whoever unf*cked their genetics would also have made them more economically useful, into an animal whose fur can be repeatedly harvested. This mod further emphasizes the entirely canon nature of genetically modified space chinchillas.
