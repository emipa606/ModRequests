[h1]Details[/h1]
Works with Rimworld Version 1.0. Haven't tested it on older versions.

Work in progress, currently undergoing balancing and re-texturing. Should work fine with existing saves. Please leave comments for feedback. Will add more weapons to this mod as soon as I feel like the ones I have so far are good enough.

All SF guns should be available from the Fabrication Bench and require Pulse Charged Munitions to be researched, with the exception of the IWA.

-No SF hairstyles and costumes yet, sorry!

As far as I know, this mod is made for vanilla and its not compatible with Combat Extended due to the way CE changes weapons. I'll consider adding support for CE once I'm satisfied with the balancing and variety of weapons.
