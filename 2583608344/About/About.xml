		<description>A mod that lets you blend fruit (and some veggies), just like the Meat Blend mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1534882140

		Big thanks to sneaks (someonesneaky) for the original Meat Blend mod that this is based on.
		
(altered) Meat Blend description:

5 fruits/veggies = 5 Fruit Blend - 250 work

20 fruits/veggies = 20 Fruit Blend - 900 work (10% faster)

50 fruits/veggies = 50 Fruit Blend - 2125 work (15% faster)

75 fruits/veggies = 75 Fruit Blend - 3000 work (20% faster)

100 fruits/veggies = 100 Fruit Blend - 4000 work (25% faster)

Each recipe stage overall takes less time [i]per volume[/i] to process. Can be used in any recipe that requires raw fruits/veggies. Can be eaten raw.

Safe to add to existing saves!

*Note: This is [i]does not[/i] include leaves or hops by design. It's strictly meant as a space-saver, not a way to sneakily feed odd things to your pawns.

Code borrowed from 'Mince that Meat' by Whizzard, modified with help from Mehni to make Veggie Mix, then further modified from Veggie Mix to make this one. (Mince That Meat can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889529242 and Veggie Blend here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1428104260 )

Thank you to erdelf, SoggyNoodle, FuriouslyEloquent, and Mehni for helping me fix the code for the changes done to 0.19, and to AUTOMATIC for the texture!
