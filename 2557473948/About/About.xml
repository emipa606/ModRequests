Break growing and cutting tasks into logical sub-units.

Breaks up and modifies the 'Growing' and 'Plant cut' work types in the following manner:

• Renamed Growing task to Sowing.
• Moves harvesting task to a new work type called Harvest.
• Reprioritized Plant cut to be next to Sowing and Harvesting

1: These are not moved out of the "Construction" work type so a pawn set to construct will also deliver items to construction projects as needed as well).
