  <description>Simply Changes the Drop Pod Arrival Mode from Industrial Tech to Spacer Tech Level.\n\nWhat that means is that it removes the use of drops from outlanders since their tech level is industrial or from other mod factions that uses industrial tech.\n\nHowever Pirate, Mechanoids &amp; Spacer or higher tech factions will still use them to raid you with drop pods.\n\nOutlanders &amp; other industrial tech factions will still use drop pods for resupplying in sieges &amp; still do sieges.\nThis Mod doesn't simply remove drop pod raids, only from industrial tech factions only.</description>
