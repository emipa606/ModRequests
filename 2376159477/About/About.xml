  <description>Penoxycyline For More

Patches Penoxycyline to also block the following:
	MuscleParasites
	Flu
	GutWorms

And for your animals:
	Animal_Plague
	Animal_Flu

Adds Lucoxycyline, a new drug that last twice as long and blocks everything Penoxycycline does as well as Fibrous and Sensory Mechanites. Craftable after Penoxycyline research with 2 Penoxycyline and 1 Luciferium.

Adds a new HD texture for Penoxycyline to better match the new drug Lucoxycyline texture.

Safe to add to saves but your drug policies and stockpiles will need to be updated.
