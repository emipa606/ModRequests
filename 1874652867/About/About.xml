HOW TO USE EMITERS
1. Research one of them and build
2. Select and configure a recipe for this emiter
3. If you selected a recipe that needs a 'Terraforming'-Area, then make a 'Terraforming'-Area/Zone in range of the emiter
4. Watch the emiter working
Hint: Replicator needs a Stockpile-Zone


HOW TO ACTIVATE LAVA ANIMATION
1. Needs a mod which have lava terrains. (Like: SZ_StonesAndTerrains or SZ_Terrains or Advanced Biomes)
2. Research 'Tectonic Emiter' under 'Terraform' tab and build it
3. Make sure you have some lava terrain on map
4. Wait for the random tick to watch the animation
Build more Tectonic-Emiter to trigger more animations.
Configure your own lava under the mod options or let it as default.


HOW TO FIX PROBLEMS WITH OLD SAVEGAMES
1. Load the mods, which are marked for your savegame.
2. Sometimes its enough to load the savegame, then let the time run for some seconds, save the game and reload again.
3. Some errors can be fixed by removing/destroying all working tables and benches, then refer to 2.
4. if you should have errors because of missing minified, then try to enable mod option 'force minified creation'.
