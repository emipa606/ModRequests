However, not all available for disclosure, discretion necessary."</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>NAME and his crew located the source of the distress call, a nearby human mining colony. An unknown disease has spread virulently among the workers. They are trying to set up a quarantine to mitigate the spread of the disease but lack any enforcement and a riot seems likely. With no fear of catching the disease, NAME helped reassure and organize the infected humans. Calmed by its extensive knowledge about human physiology, the infected submit to the quarantine in the hopes that a cure can be found soon.An ugly incident was prevented.</baseDescription>

    <title>The Engi Virus</title>
    <titleShort>EngieFake</titleShort>
	<baseDescription>The Engi are awaiting you at the beacon, with their weapons on-line! They explain a computer virus that is wanted for hostile acts against the Engi (multiple counts of binary scrambling, nano-dissolution, and variable interference) is aboard your vessel. As the Engi attempts to contact the vessel and negotiate, your Engi crewmember suddenly dissolves into nanites - the virus has murdered again! Detecting activity on board your ship, the Engi vessel opens fire!To your surprise your Engi crewmember reforms. With all the Engi dead, you take what you can and prepare to jump away. It looks as if the virus reconstituted, repurposed, and reprogrammed the Engi host and wants to travel with you... and it seems to have learned a great deal from its time on your ship.</baseDescription>

    <title>Two Smashed Ships</title>
    <titleShort>EngieChroot</titleShort>
	<baseDescription>What appeared to be a single damaged ship is in fact two ships that have smashed into each other... there is a flurry of comm signals and damage, and it's hard to determine what occurred. The vessels appear to be... Engi? They look locked together by the impact and can't free themselves.Your Engi crewmember refuses. In a halting use of adjectives and nouns, followed by some animated holographic aids, the Engi explains the ships are... using each other to, loosely translated, "achieve a union." For some reason, this consolidation of ship matter sounds embarrassing and personal.

    You elect to leave the two Engi ships... to their "business." After questioning your Engi crewmember, however, you do manage to salvage what scrap parts you can from the perimeter, even though you feel slightly dirty for doing so.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system, having picked up your distress beacon. While it doesn't have much fuel to spare, it's hull looks damaged - it is in bad need of scrap and is willing to trade fuel for it. Your Engi analyzes scans of the extensive damage to their hull, calculating potential repair costs. The refugees grumble and protest, but in the end, they admit that their need for repairs is greater than their fuel surplus and offer a better trade.</baseDescription>

    <title>Nebula seen Ships Exchange Fire</title>

	<baseDescription>This nebula looks like it's recently seen two ships exchange fire... with mutually-assured destructive results. Wreckage drifts by your screens and tumbles into the depths of the nebula to be lost to sight. It's hard to determine who the combatants were without closer investigation.The wreckage is drifting faster than it first appeared. You barely avoid being pummeled by drifting wreckage - unable to detect anything of interest, you decide not to risk your ship and prepare to jump.Your bring the survivor aboard, but discover their wounds are severe. They won't live much longer.

    Make them comfortable for their final moments.
        On their death bed, they croak out a series of coordinates and beg you to go there - when you attempt to ask them why, the survivor simply says, "ABADOTH" and perishes.</baseDescription>
