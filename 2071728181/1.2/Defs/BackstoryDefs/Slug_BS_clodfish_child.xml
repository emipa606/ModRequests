    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] has always been curious. A fact nurtured by [PAWN_pronoun] parents, who filled [PAWN_possessive] young brain with texts of economics, history and politics. What was left was a slug that always questioned why people do the things they do. Except every time [PAWN_nameDef] asked a person's intentions, [PAWN_pronoun] was left with vague answers or lies. Growing tired of this, [PAWN_nameDef] chose to skip a step and learned to see directly into people mind. But whenever [PAWN_nameDef] looked into someone's mind, prying into their very soul, [PAWN_pronoun] fell in love. To [PAWN_nameDef] consciousness is the most beautiful thing in the universe.

    <baseDescription>Most psychic skills are learnt over time but for [PAWN_nameDef] it came from one event. [PAWN_pronoun] was following [PAWN_possessive] crush. Someone [PAWN_pronoun] thought [PAWN_pronoun] would love for ever. They were walking through [PAWN_possessive] parents construction site and [PAWN_pronoun] was building up the courage to ask [PAWN_possessive] crush out but then disaster struck. A large stone fell from the scaffolding and rocketed its way down to the ground, right onto of [PAWN_possessive] crush. In a fit of panic [PAWN_nameDef] yelled out stop, and the stone obeyed.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] never knew [PAWN_possessive] parents, [PAWN_pronoun] was left abandoned in the pits of scum and villainy known as the Cave Streets. Quickly taken in by a gang, [PAWN_nameDef] learnt hard and fast how to recognise a friend from a foe, the blues of a cop, the greens of our rivals and the reds of your friends. The threat of random violence at anytime led to advances in [PAWN_nameDef]'s senses. This manifested when a sniper from over 200 metres away shot at [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_pronoun] ducked, just in time. It was after this [PAWN_possessive] gang issued [PAWN_objective] a gun and [PAWN_pronoun] never missed a shot.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef]'s life was filled with misfortune. One trip through the Cave Streets saw [PAWN_possessive] parents dead and [PAWN_objective] moving into a orphanage. Except this was no ordinary orphanage, it was an underground casino and [PAWN_pronoun] was their newest waiter. [PAWN_nameDef] just took this in [PAWN_possessive] stride. [PAWN_pronoun] was comfortable here, [PAWN_pronoun] could witness other people's misfortune and feel like [PAWN_pronoun] was not the only one. [PAWN_pronoun] got really used to that feeling, misfortune. So much that [PAWN_pronoun] could see it coming. [PAWN_pronoun] started giving people tips on what to bet on and the casino lost so much money they decided to kick [PAWN_objective] out. [PAWN_pronoun] was alright though, the world's a whole lot better when you know what not to do. </baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] spent a lot of time watching things die, it fascinated [PAWN_objective]. But one day [PAWN_pronoun] realised what would be [PAWN_possessive] fate someday too. Fear of eternal non-existence gripped [PAWN_objective] and never let go. [PAWN_pronoun] set about reading every doctoring text [PAWN_pronoun] could find. Attempt after attempt to saves lives, mostly those of small animals, [PAWN_pronoun] cried out “please, please come back to me.” and it did. [PAWN_pronoun] spent the rest of [PAWN_possessive] childhood caring for people, healing small cuts for fellow children at the playground. Everyone thought [PAWN_nameDef] was the nicest guy but [PAWN_pronoun] really didn’t care about them, they were just practice.</baseDescription>
