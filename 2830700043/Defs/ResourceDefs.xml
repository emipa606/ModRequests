    <label>megabee egg (unfert.)</label>
    <description>An unfertilized megabee egg. It can be eaten raw, but it's much, much better cooked. These human-torso-sized eggs are somewhat unappetizing, but can feed a small family all by themselves.</description>

<!-- For those who don't know what tallow is, it's rendered fat; usually pork. Tallow can be eaten, but it's far more commonly used as the basis for soap (mirrored in the mod by using it to make medicine). -->

    <defName>MegabeeTallow</defName>
    <label>megabee tallow</label>
    <description>A close relative of giant insect jelly, produced by Megabees. It maintains a somewhat thin consistency until exposed to open air, at which point the outermost layers of the substance gelatinize, making storage remarkably trivial. On worlds capable of raising them, children often snack on large handfuls of "Megabee Geysers", which are small dollops of Megabee Tallow allowed to solidify into small candies with a chewy outside and liquid tallow within. It has antimicrobial properties, meaning it will never cause food poisoning, and it can even be fashioned into a salve of similar effectiveness to healroot extract.</description>

<!-- Turns out that bee fur is actually constructed like a feather, with a central rachis (spine) with many smol widdle fwoofs coming off the main stem. This is reflected in the mod as being nearly as tough as hyperweave. -->
  
  <ThingDef ParentName="ResourceBase">
    <defName>WoolMegabee</defName>
    <label>megabee wool</label>
    <description>A stiff, fibrous psuedo-wool harvested from Megabees. Though it's not particularly soft, it has fair all-around temperature regulation and is resistant to heat. It's a good material for clothing or structures thanks to its rather incredible durability, and the sheer bounty of it that can be shorn from even a single megabee.</description>
