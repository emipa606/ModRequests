  You know how when you select a production item, "Toolbox" shows up as a buildable thing?
  
  Wouldn't it be nice if that same thing happened for - say - chairs when selecting tables, or wires when selecting objects that require or generate power?
  
  Well now they do! And a lot of other things too!
  
  If you have any requests just ask. I can't promise I'll add it (especially if it's for a mod) but it never hurts to ask.
  
  Known bugs:
  1) This doesn't work when you don't own the items. For example, selecting a wall in the terrain that you haven't "claimed" will not let you build a door. I consider this not really a problem so am not looking into it.
