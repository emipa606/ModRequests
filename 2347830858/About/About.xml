  <description>It's a gumball machine!
  
  Adds a gumball machine to the Recreation tab after researching Complex Furniture. Once built, the gumball machine can be provided with silver and gumballs can be purchased by right clicking the machine.
  Gumballs have a random chance to give bonuses or malices to certain skills (catastrophic outcomes result in a mental break- disabled by default). The effect of each gumball lasts a day.
  
  Gumball cost, Length of the Effect, Possible Outcomes, and Outcome Chances can all be modified in the mod settings.
  
  For a more decorative machine that provides occasional mood bonuses, simply disable all outcomes.</description>
