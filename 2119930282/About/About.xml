  <description>Version: 1.4


I've always loved the mechanoid concept, however I kept finding them rather lackluster in terms of actual combat(even modded mechs were somewhat disappointing due to vanilla balance hugging). On top of that their salvage yields were hard nerfed to the point mechs became just a massive boredom to fight since there was minimal reward gained for dealing with them.

As a result I decided to make my own mod that greatly extends mechanoid arsenal, from multiple weapons to 
specialised mech fighters while also staying closer to mechanoid lore and making them far more dangerous than the vanilla mechs.
Additionally, these mechs also provide not only good amount of resources but also unique parts that can be repurposed into many useful things with the right research and skill. It can also be sold or refined into simple materials.

Note: these mechs are meant to be far more challenging than the vanilla mechanoids, being unprepared and using outdated weapons will result in the destruction of colonies. I also recommend using other mods that extend weapon and armor choices such as vanilla expanded, rimsenal, rimmu-nation etc. as vanilla weapons can strugle with heavy mechs and vanilla armor will barely protect from the hell these mechs bring.
