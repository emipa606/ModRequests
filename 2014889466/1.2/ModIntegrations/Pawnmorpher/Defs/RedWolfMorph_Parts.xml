		<label>red wolf muzzle</label>
		<description>Following exposure to mutagenic mechanites, a slender red wolf snout has replaced this pawn's face completely with a set of fangs and pointed teeth.  It's perfect for biting and tearing through meat, but depending on the exact form the mutation has taken it may severely hampen their ability to speak.
		
Wolves are known for hunting with their teeth and not their claws, and wolfmorphs are no different.  With practice, red wolf morphs can use their muzzles to harry their opponents in battle to create openings, which more than makes up for any difficulties they may have at wielding weapons with inflexible paws.</description>

				<description>A slender, red wolf snout graces [PAWN_nameDef]'s face, completely with a set of fangs and pointed teeth -- perfect for biting with.  The mechanites have made further modifications and have managed to subtly blend elements of human anatomy into the otherwise-lupine muzzle, allowing [PAWN_objective] to speak and express [PAWN_possessive]self as well as any human despite it.  While [PAWN_nameDef]'s wolfish face may not be beautiful in the traditional sense, the perfectly-sculpted wolf muzzle and head now lends [PAWN_objective] a certain elegance.</description>

A morph with these eyes will suffer at most vision-related tasks but once they adapt to the specialized senses they will fare better in melee combat than a baseline human.</description>
