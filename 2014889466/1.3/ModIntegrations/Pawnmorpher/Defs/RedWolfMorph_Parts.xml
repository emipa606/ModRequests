        <label>red wolf muzzle</label>
        <description>Following exposure to mutagenic mechanites, a slender red wolf snout has replaced this pawn's face completely with a set of fangs and pointed teeth.  It's perfect for biting and tearing through meat.
        
Wolves are known for hunting with their teeth and not their claws, and wolfmorphs are no different.  While red wolf morphs have slightly weaker bites than their larger timber wolf morph cousins, they can use their increased agility to harry an opponent in combat, giving them more chances to land a hit.</description>

        <description>Golden- or orange-colored wolf eyes with a large, black-ringed iris.  They look striking, especially on a mutated human, but alas they are red-green colorblind.

A morph with these eyes will suffer slightly at most vision-related tasks and significantly at ranged combat, but once they adapt to their specialized senses they will fare much better in melee combat than a baseline human.</description>
