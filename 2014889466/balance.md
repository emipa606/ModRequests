Notes on balancing

## v1.5.1
**Pawnmorpher compatability**
_Regular red wolf morph_
The red wolf morph is slightly smaller than a timber wolf morph (0.85/1.00), which makes them slightly more fragile. They also have inherent penalties to ranged combat. They make up for it by having significant bonuses to melee combat (slightly better than a brawler, but not as good as a full-bionic supersoldier).  They are meant to be good as hit-and-run troopers but not tanks.

Muzzle: +1.0 melee hit chance, bite attack (8.0 power)
 - Balance note:  Does slightly less direct damage than other carnivore bites.  Has a slight bonus to hit chance to represent "harrying" as a tradeoff.
 
Ears: +(1.0 * 2) dodge chance, -(0.05 * 2) work speed
 - Balance note:  Better in combat than timber wolf ears, but a slight workspeed penalty because the jumpy red wolf morph can't stop reacting to noises.

Eyes: -5% efficiency, +(1.8 * 2) melee hit chance, +(1.2 * 2) melee dodge chance, -(1.2 * 2) ranged hit chance
 - Total melee hit chance is (1.8*2 - 0.6 from sight penalty) = +3.0
 - Total melee dodge chance is (1.2*2 - 0.4 from sight penalty) = +2.0
 - Total ranged hit chance is (-1.2*2 - 0.6 from sight penalty) = -3.0
 - Balance notes:  Specialized for melee combat, with penalties to everything else.  In melee combat, slightly better than reptile eyes and equivalent to bionic eyes.  Slightly worse than normal eyes at everything else, but significantly worse at ranged combat specifically.
 
Overall combat stats:
- Melee hit chance: +4.0 (Same as Brawler)
- Melee dodge chance: +4.0 (1/4 as good as Nimble, adds at most 8% dodge)
- Ranged hit chance: -3.0 (Equivalent to missing an eye)
- Health: -15% (from body size)
   

_Paragon red wolf morph_
The paragon red wolf morph is both better at its strengths and suffers from less weaknesses, making them excellent melee specialists aside from their fragility. They do not completely lose their weakness to ranged combat, and even their more powerful strengths can't match a bionic-enhanced pawn completely.

Muzzle: +2.0 melee hit chance, bite attack (8.0 power), +0.5 beauty
 - Balance note:  Higher hit chance buff than the normal muzzle, but otherwise the same.  Also has a minor beauty buff because they're elegant
 
Ears: +(2.0 * 2) dodge chance, -(0.05 * 2) work speed
 - Balance note:  Even better at dodging, but don't lose their work speed penalty.  Helps to make up for their fragility.

Eyes: +(2.5 * 2) melee hit chance, +(2.0 * 2) melee dodge chance, -(1.2 * 2) ranged hit chance
 - Total melee hit chance is 2.5*2 = +5.0
 - Total melee dodge chance is 2.0*2 = +4.0
 - Total ranged hit chance is -1.2*2 = -2.4
 - Balance notes:  Still specialized for melee combat, but no longer with an efficiency penalty.  In melee combat, slightly better than paragon reptile eyes but worse than archotech eyes.  Equivalent to normal eyes at everything else, except ranged combat which still suffers.  Now better than bionic eyes at melee combat, if you're willing to sacrifice every other benefit of bionic eyes.
 
Overall combat stats:
- Melee hit chance: +7.0 (Almost as good as Melee Specialist)
- Melee dodge chance: +8.0 (1/2 as good as Nimble, adds at most 16% dodge)
- Ranged hit chance: -2.4 (Almost as bad as missing an eye)
- Health: -15% (from body size)
