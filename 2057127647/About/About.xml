  <description>Adds shields to Rimworld. Chancoco is the orginal Author, I've remade mod to be more balanced and work in 1.1.
  Added 2 neolithic shields, 3 medieval shields, and one industrial. You can use it as handy framework for your shield mod. If you wish to redraw this mod, please contact me, as I'm a poor drawer myself.
  More details on steam workshop page.
