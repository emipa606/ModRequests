    <description>Are you tired of your pawns feeling bad every time a prisoner starves to death?  Don't think it's fair that you have to justify every single prisoner execution, while raiders can just bust in whenever they want and try to murder all your dogs?  Want to make kibble out of human flesh without everyone freaking out about it?

This mod changes your pawns' feelings about bad stuff happening to prisoners.  They'll feel absolutely nothing about committing heinous atrocities, like organ harvesting and straight-up mass murder.  They still won't want to eat human flesh or wear hats made of human skin, but they won't care about butchering your prisoners or skinning them alive.

After all, those jerks tried to murder &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; and take &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; stuff -- so why should you treat them any better?

Unfortunately, this mod also removes sympathy for guests.  Please show your own sympathy for innocent guests.
