  <description>Project Pangaea is a mod aimed at adding a variety of rather realistic prehistoric fauna. Other mods also do this so why another one? Well, I decided to make this either because the style of other mods didn't suit me or because I wanted a mod that allows you to create your own animals that would still stay realistic.</description>
