<description>
A retexture to the hairs from the base game, and this is intended to be used with [NL] Facial Animation heads. May suitable for vanilla heads. Concerning the beards, please turn on the 'Fix beard misaligment' setting in the FA's mod setting if you use non vanilla-shaped heads. A successor of my former hair retexture, but with beards added since the game makes me upload a new mod instead of updating that one.

Update(4/16/2023)
1.5 support and added Royalty hairs, alongside the beards from the base game and Biotech DLC. Next is the hairs from Anomaly DLC...
