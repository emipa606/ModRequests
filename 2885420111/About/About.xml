Back in the launch days of 1.1 and Royalty psycasts with levels above the level of a user's royal title were illegal for them (so for example Acolyte was allowed to use psycasts of level 1 and 2, but not 3 and above).
Each time a colonist used an illegal psycast, there was a chance for this act to be detected by the Empire and the penalty for breaking imperial law was degradation of relationship with the Empire by 4 points.
As an alternative to keeping fingers crossed Empire wouldn't notice players could install a dedicated brain implant - psychic silencer - into their psycasters' heads, which at a price of increasing pain level by 20 percent points removed the risk of illegal psycast usage detection. It was hard to come by, but the Deserter quest had one as a part of its guaranteed reward.
Features described above had been removed some time after launch and the aim of this mod is to simply bring them back.

## FAQ
- "But why, players hated it and that's why devs removed it!"
  True, but I believe that, combined with the ability to extract psylink amplifiers from the heads of imperial people (restored by this amazing mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110931217), it added a lot of depth to the rebel path - after it was removed player could either fight Empire in an all-out war or not. But since Deserter quest appears early and Empire is powerful, open war can be too much for young colonies to handle, hence it can pay off to be a little sneaky and raise relationship to neutral ASAP after Deserter quest and then try to lay low and prepare to strike. Illegal psycasts add a challenge to this "lay low" stage because use psycasts too many times and you bring the relationship back to hostility again. This mod is for the ones who might find it interesting to try to dodge imperial law for a bit.
  
## Compatibility
- ***Requires Royalty DLC.***
- Should simply work, unless something overrides rewards for the Deserter quest, in which case you might not get psychic silencer as a reward for doing it.
