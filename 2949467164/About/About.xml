New Update
- Fix wools for the synthread recipe, now work also with wools from other mods.

About
This mod adds new recipes for uncraftable items from fabrication bench and drug lab, recipes are unlocked through new research.
I tried to balance to be as close as possible to the vanilla game, the ingredients cost is around the cost of the finished product. The researches can be unlocked with the Fabrication research as a prerequisite, to limit access in early game.
