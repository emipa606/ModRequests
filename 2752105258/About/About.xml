    <description>"The SDC Navy (abbrev. SDCN) has a total of 210 commissioned ships in active service, 115 noncommissioned support craft, and more than 55,000 shuttlecraft. 23 commissioned vessels are part of the Final Frontier Project. It has 4.4 million enlisted personnel with about 900,000 officers.

The Navy employs corvettes, frigates, cruisers, battlecruisers, and carriers, with a style of varying their class complement strongly to emphasize versatility and readiness for any situation.

During times of peace, the SDCN focuses resources on maritime policing in the Sol system as well as functioning as a counter-piracy service. The Sixth Fleet in particular operates the Final Frontier Project for scientific efforts."

Mark your soldiers as members of the Sol Defense Corps Navy with this Pawn Badge mod, including:
Enlisted Rank Insignias (E-1 to E-9s)
Officer Rank Insignias (O-1 to O-11)
SDCN Roles + Naval Development Researcher Role Badges

I will gladly expand this mod! If you want the actual SDCN logo, the UN logo, and the Naval Development Group logo added, let me know!
