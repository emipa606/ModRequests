	<description>Introducing the new headwear options for your colonists with this mod pack! Included in this pack are two stylish and practical hats: the cavalry hat and the Kepi. Both hats come in two colors, blue and gray, giving you a range of options to choose from to suit your colonists' individual style and preferences.

The cavalry hat is a rugged and stylish headgear option, providing ample protection from the elements with its wide brim and high crown. Made from durable materials, it's perfect for long treks across the rimworld, herding livestock, or exploring new territories.

The Kepi, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated and traditional military-style cap, perfect for those looking to add a touch of authority and elegance to their outfits. Its flat, stiff brim and distinctive shape make it a standout accessory, and it's designed to fit snugly on the head for added comfort and security.

With both the cavalry hat and Kepi available in both blue and gray colors, this mod pack offers a variety of headwear options for your colonists. So whether they're heading into battle or just going about their daily tasks, they'll look great and feel protected with these stylish and practical hats.
