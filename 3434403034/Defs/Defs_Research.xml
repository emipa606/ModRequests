		<description>Build the sensory collapser to bombard a prisoner with lights, noise, and propaganda, causing sensory overload and inducing the early stages of stockholm syndrome upon successful sensory collapse. The prisoner becomes recruitable when they reach full-blown stockholm syndrome.\n\nBuild prisoner restraints to accelerate prisoner resistance decay through immobilization, sensory overload, humiliation, and physical sufferingt.</description>
