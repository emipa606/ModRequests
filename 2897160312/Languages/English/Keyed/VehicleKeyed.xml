	<WhippleShieldDesc>The whipple shield is an high tech defense system that can completely neutralize a single attack above its absorb threshold, consuming one charge in the process, while letting lesser damages pass through. Maintaining the shield requires constant power from capacitor, and recharging will drain extra power in the process. EMP attacks will shut down the shield, while explosions can easily break multiple layers.\n\nClicking on this gizmo will toggle the shield.\n</WhippleShieldDesc>

	<AblativeShieldDesc>The Ablative shield is an high tech defense system that works much like a normal personal shield, neutralizing damage while consuming charge equivalent of the damage amount. Maintaining the shield requires constant power from capacitor, and recharging will drain extra power in the process.

	<ECSShieldDesc>The ECS shield is an high tech defense system that completely nullify damages below its damage threshold, without any additional strain on power grid apart from maintenance power. But any damage above the threshold will break the shield. Attacks will cause stress that reduces threshold until a certain minimal value, while stress will dissipate on its own, regardless whether the shield is on or off, under attack or destroyed. EMP attacks will shut down the shield. ECS shields are exceptional at stopping explosions and have a much higher threshold against them.\n\nClicking on this gizmo will toggle the shield.\n</ECSShieldDesc>
