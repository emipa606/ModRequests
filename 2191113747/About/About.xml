THIS IS A CONTINUED VERSION OF LOOT BOXES TO WORK WITH 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 &amp; 1.4.

You can find the original mod here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1560291802

All credit goes to the original creator. I only grabbed the project, revived it and made it work for 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 &amp; 1.4.

If the original creator wishes for me to take this down, I will.
In the meantime, I have made a PR on their GitHub for them to update their code to work in 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 &amp; 1.4.
You can find this PR here: https://github.com/Lanilor/Rimworld-Loot-Boxes/pull/2

Original source code: https://github.com/Lanilor/Rimworld-Loot-Boxes
This fork's source code: https://github.com/Pustalorc/Rimworld-Loot-Boxes

Changes from the original version:
 - Obfuscated spawn tables have been removed and replaced with the in-game rewards generator (modded loot now also spawns!)
 - Reward frequency has been reduced and the game decides when to reward loot boxes
 - Load order was specified to be after harmony
 - Added spanish translations
 - Loot boxes can be configured (Min and max drops, drop reward value, chance for other lootboxes to drop)
