  <description>"Fallen Stars" adds two pirate factions that raid the lightly defended worlds of the rim.  Pirates from the stars, and their descendants, these savage raiders revel in chaos and destruction. 
  This mod adds:  New faction; Starbarians, recently landed barbarians from space.  Well armed and armored, they cannot be allied with. New faction; Savage Fallen Star Tribes, savage tribals relatively recently landed from the stars.  They still use a few working high tech weapons and equipment, but have torn their ships apart for scrap and to fashion weapons.  They cannot be allied with.</description>
