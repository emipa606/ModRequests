<description>Adds a collection of 60+ royal-themed hairstyles to Rimworld. All hairstyles have been rendered at 512 x 512 resolution, so it should work with all upscaling mods. I hope you enjoy using this mod as much as I did making it. Visit the Steam Workshop Page if you have any issues, suggestions or ideas for future cosmetic mods.

Do not use in conjunction with the Lite or Legacy versions of Roo's Royalty Hairstyles â€” this can result in the game throwing errors and making certain hairs disappear.
