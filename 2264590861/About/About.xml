Animal Patches is a mod that includes several patches that changes the behaviour of some animals, mostly restoring them to how they were in previous versions.
All the different patches can be changed in the settings menu, but the game has to be restarted in order for them to be applied.

Currently Patches:
- Milkable Muffalos: Muffalos can be milked again.
- Shearable Yaks: Yaks can be sheared again. Also adds Yak Wool.
- Smarter Boars: Boars have advanced intelligence.
- (Vanilla Animals Expanded - Ice Sheet) Seals and Walrus On Ice: Seals and Walrus's can spawn in the Sea Ice biome.
