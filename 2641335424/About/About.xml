	<description>Adds an avid hunter trait to the game with associated hunting-related thoughts. Avid hunters gain recreation from hunting and will occasionally go hunting as a joy activity. When selecting targets, more skilled hunters (based on shooting and animal skills) have a greater chance of pursuing more dangerous prey. Avid hunters prefer action and will not wander sadly or in their own rooms when having a mental breakdown.
