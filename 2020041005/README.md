# RimWorld-ReviaRaceMod
Temporary and limited 1.4 update until FoxWithAShotgun updates the mod
Not tested much beyond embark.

An alien race mod for bloodthirsty foxgirls.

Revia grow stronger with the more humanlike kills they get, which also increases the number of tails they possess. A Revia with no kills to her name is slightly weaker than a baseline human, while those with hundreds to their name and a full set of nine tails is incredibly dangerous and durable. Their lifespan is slightly longer than a human's, though their bloodthirsty nature usually means that they often meet a violent end before they die a natural death. Their society holds a dark god in the highest regard, performing daily sacrifices in the name of a certain deity that sits upon a throne of bleached skulls.

Features:
- Revia are guaranteed to have the Bloodlust trait, and are likely to have some positive degree of the beauty trait.
- Revia never have Wimp. One that cannot fight is soon to die.
- Revia are very likely to have some level of scarring on them.
- Revia have a mechanic that lets them grow in stats. Visually, this is seen as additional tails. Levels can be gained by sacrificing humanlikes or trophies, and then offering up increasing amounts of these trophies.
- Revia may wear any clothing that a baseline human can wear, and will NEVER have any restrictions in regards to equipment. I don't believe in restricting the user's choice in what mods are used; season your own game as you need!
- Revia factions often send out marauding warbands to shed blood in the name of their god. Whether this blood is your colonists', or that of the attacking Revia marauders', matters very little to them -- blood is blood, and they will never retreat.
- Revia factions are hostile to all except for their own race. However, they are still receptive to gifts (read: tribute). Their constant warring and raiding means that they tend to have highly effective weapons and armour for sale, if you somehow satisfy their thirst for plunder.
