Were you planning on staying at that mining site for twelve days? Probably not. Do you want the game to bother you by sending you a letter telling you that you'll get raided if you stay too long? Every single time? Probably not???

With this mod, the game will not send you a "Caravan detected" letter, but you can still see the alert on the right side of the screen that says how much time you have left.
