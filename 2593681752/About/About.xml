Here at KYD Industries, we value the safety and security of our customers all across the Rim. We have a special offer for you! Simply download and install this software upgrade to supercharge your turret AI!
	
Patches almost every single turret to reduce the cooldown between "bursts" to almost 0 (0.2), and sets the burst warmup to 1. This produces the effect of a nearly endless stream of bullets, right up until the ammo runs out! Does not affect mortars, artillery, manned defenses, or mech clusters.
