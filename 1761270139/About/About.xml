<description>Various types of xenofungus that grow without needing any light (and will die when exposed to light). They are less efficient than outdoor varieties.
* Vanetike - vegetable
* Melrotus - Meat substitute
* Helatrophica - a long-lived ugly light-producing plant, can only be planted in pots
* Cococazine - can be processed into chocolate
* Laeti - produces fibers that can be processed into Cloth or Synthread
* Scarik Orb - produces small amounts of milk
* Neutrophyria - can be processed into neutroamine
* Colossal Sanozite - a very large mushroom which can be processed into herbal medicine
* Xylem Tuber - produces a small amount of wood
* Frigia - produces crystals that can be used to cool down a room (but not to freezing)
* Pyrazite - produces crystals that can be burned to heat up a room (not as efficient as a campfire, but doesn't produce as much light)
* Unlock new varieties of hops, psychite, smokeleaf and devilstrand that you can grow without needing light.

New drug recipes: 
* Alcavorax. This blocks gut worms, muscle parasites, fibrous mechanites and sensory mechanites (works like penoxycyline so only blocks new infections). It lasts for 8 days.
* BrainLok. Negates psychic sensitivity.
* ToxAway. Negates toxic fallout.
* Spyke. Powerful combat enhancing drug.
* Chocoroto rollo. Blissful recreation drug.

Spacer-tech:
* Highly advanced semi-organic constructs that provide light, heat a room or chill a room to freezing without needing power.

You can now place down low-fertility Fungal Soil on stone ground, allowing you to expand underground farms. This is under the Misc tab.

Everyone can plant Vanetike by default. Tribals start out with the Basic Xenofungus research already known, giving them access to Melrotus, Helatrophica and Xylem Tuber.
