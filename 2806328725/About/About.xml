I've always loved being able to break through the roof of your pawn's potential once you unlock bionics and creating an army of super-capable pawns. I also love the idea of having pawns who are in-tune with nature and co-exist with dryads. Trying to do both, however, takes twice as long! So now it'll be a little bit easier to do with Dryadics: Dryad Bionics!

This mod introduces a new caste of dryads: The RuneMakers.
These new dryads produce a special rare resource known only as RuneWood, which can be used to imbue your pawns with legendary bionic powers, however use your runewood sparingly as their magic takes best effect in smaller objects.
