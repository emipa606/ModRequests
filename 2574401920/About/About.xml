A super lightweight mod I whipped up for myself for roleplay purposes. It researches at a ridiculously low default rate of 30%, but it takes up 1 tile and 1 interaction spot of space total and doesn't cost anything. Great for if you want to drag out neolithic playthroughs and/or feel like the default research table seems a little anachronistic for tribals.
