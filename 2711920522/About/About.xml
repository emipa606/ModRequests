A mod that adds more randomly generated words, such as names,artwork titles, and more.

[color=orange][b]Description 2[/b][/color]
I have gone into all of the xml folders and increaced most if not all generators. I still need synonyms for lake and island though, and be on the look out for grammer and spelling errors.
I still need to do Royalty DLC. 
[color=orange][size=18pt] Translate?[/size][/color]
If you would like to translate let me know.
I have no idea how through, so your on your own.

ummm...so I really don't know if I can copywrite, it's literally just a list of words.
But I do have this rule:
Use as much of this as you want BUT you can't just copy and paste the folder. You must work for it like I did :D .
