    <description>Rimlaris is a series of modifications aimed at adding elements from the game Stellaris, to bring a new gameplay experience, but at the same time preserve the Rimworld vibe.

The Rimlaris music pack adds most of the tracks that I found most suitable. There are a total of over 50 tracks, including music from all the DLC released so far. This OST is perfect for a long and ultratech game.

This version for music expanded framework. You can find standalone version in the workshop.

I do not pretend to own these soundtracks. All credits and copyrights go to Paradox interective, as well as the composers of the original soundtracks.
