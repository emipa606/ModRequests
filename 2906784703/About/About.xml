  <description>Ever felt your colonists need more horse colours in their lives? Now they can have a ridiculous number! This mod adds over 120 realistic horse coat variations so even Mare 143 can feel special. It also reskins the Divine Order and Profaned horses and adds more variants for them.
	This mod shouldn't affect horses added by mods other than Divine Order and The Profaned, only the vanilla horses. Load after any other texture-altering mods that affect horses.</description>
