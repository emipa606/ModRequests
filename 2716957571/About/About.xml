Have you ever felt like vanilla humans lacked an appropriate skeletal structure?
Yeah... me neither.

With Bones, every humanlike pawn now comes with all 206 bones found in the human body.
Want to watch those new bone fractures roll in during combat? Or surgically remove the vertebrae from an unruly colonist? Maybe human bones can be your colony's next big export?!
Bones gives you more dastardly sadistic control and pleasure than you ever thought you needed.

Have fun and thanks for giving this mess of a mod a shot!
