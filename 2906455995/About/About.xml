  <description>Mod Adds Several new Beam Laser guns to the Spacer factions and trade inventories.

Beam weapons are useful weapons harnessed by the outer world factions and developed their own form of concentrated laser-type technology to focus on single targets more than the group of targets more common guns are known for, being able to slow, debuff and singe out more difficult targets, beam weapons are particularly useful for much more single armored targets or those with a natural in-born armor and shield capacity threshold.

Beam weapons come in a variety of flavors, and deliver a concentrated punch of energy after a long initial warmup time. Thankfully beam weapons do not need to be cooled down once they start firing. Beam weapons target a 1x1 cell for damage which slowly builds up in amplitude the longer the shot connects with its target, making beam weapons some of the most dangerous guns you could acquire given patience. And a well focused squad that knows well to allocate target designation.

The weapons can only be found as quest rewards, on trader caravans, and Spacer factions such as the imperials of the royalty DLC, or any custom spacer factions you might have installed.</description>
