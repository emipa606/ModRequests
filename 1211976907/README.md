# ButchersCanCountMeat
### By Rock5
Allows Rimworld butcher bills to use the Do Until option.

Adds the following butcher recipes;
- Butcher animal
- Butcher human
- Butcher insect
- Butcher animal or human
- Butcher human or insect

Each recipe counts only the type of meat in it's name. The original butcher recipe and any other custom butcher recipes from other mods will count ALL meat types.

Requires HugsLib.
