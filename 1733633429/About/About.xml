Rimcraft Metals, a fantasy ore sub-mod used for Rimcraft or used stand-alone.

Feature Overview
  -  New WoW-Lore related ores and ingots such as Thorium and Dark Iron, which have special properties.

This mod is very much a work in progress, with the intent to add more custom lore-specific metals fitting within the Warcraft universe. Constructive criticism, suggestions, and ideas are very much appreciated.

For more information or if you're interested in helping with the project, feel free to check out our discord if you have a personal question for me about the mod, or post pictures related to the mod. https://discord.gg/3Dp7Zug

Specific Metal values can be found here, as well as a comparison to how they differ from existing metals. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MrG2TJ-qC3HCUQsieB-Lm6vZK2D32Si1tvnuCozI1Xk/edit#gid=1086916333
