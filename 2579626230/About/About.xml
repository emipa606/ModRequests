  <description> Supermutants are a stronger, tougher FEV mutated humanoid that need to eat more, but their strength lets them carry more as well as mine quicker. They have some innate armor due to their mutations and are immune to toxins.
  Nightkin are more stealthy and agile then a Supermutant, as well as being more intelligent. They do however, suffer greatly socially due to their stealth boy withdrawl induced paranoia.
