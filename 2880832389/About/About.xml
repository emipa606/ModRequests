Genepacks are a pain in the ass to get. It's a crapshoot every time you get an exotic trader.

This mod aims to add a trader with an extensive genepack stock to pick from. It's not a guarantee, but this trader has many times more genepacks to sell, so getting what you actually want should be easier as a result.
