		<label>Civil Resistence chip</label>
		<description>A microchip containing Civil Resistence's blueprints. Packed with instructions of various files of fabrication executable of higher tier weaponry and armor. 
However, without the necessary fabrication devices with the corporate software, extensive research is required to decode and replicate these designs.
Due to an excessive level of Backdoor protection, once the chip's blueprints are copied, it will self-destruct to prevent any further tampering or unauthorized distribution.
Due to a careless colnode the chip is permenantly imprinted with code of "Tetris: 20XX edition" leading many of the traders to believe it's a simple cartridge of digital entertainment.</description>
