		<content>The mod setting of Bill Doors' weapon jams has underwent a major overhaul, which would require you to press the reset button in the mod settings or set it yourself, otherwise weapon jam chances can behave weirdly.\n\nOther changes includes:\n-Make chance sliders works in an order of ^1.5, making it easier to fine tune the last 10%.\n-Greatly decreased and reworked weapon hitpoint penalty, with more sliders in mod settings.\n-Better visibility of weapon jam chance instead of hidding in a black box, now you can see weapon jam chance in info panel and when a weapon jams.\n-Optional behaviour of weapons damaging user's hand when it breaks from jams.\n-Fixed a red-letter when weapon breaks in CE.\n-Fixed a red-letter when one switchs from vanilla to CE, a side effect of major code clean up.</content>
