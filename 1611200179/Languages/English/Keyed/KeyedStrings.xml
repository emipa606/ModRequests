	<RH_MSFFriendliesMSF_Text>Big Boss speaks to you with his gravelly voice over the radio. Reminiscing about his old mentor, "The Boss".
	
"In the end, she put down her gun... and when she did... she rejected everything in her life up to that point, including me.

In giving up her life she abandoned everything she was as a soldier... We won't make the same choice as her.

Our future is going to be different." 

The call ends. Militaires Sans Fronti√®res acknowledge you as comrades.</RH_MSFFriendliesMSF_Text>
