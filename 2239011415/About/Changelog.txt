GAS TRAPS AND SHELLS MOD RETEXTURE PACK

Version 2.3.1

- Potential fix for the missing textures for players using Combat Extended and CE - Chemical Warfare
(If pink squares are still showing up or other problems still persist, please let me know.)
- As a consequence, added a requirement to load this mod after Combat Extended - Chemical Warfare.
- Transferred the dropdown menus to my other mod, Dropdown Menus Expanded Collection.
- A few minor changes and additions for my own sanity, no texture changes.

Version 2.3.0

- Added dropdown menu support for both gas traps and vents.

Version 2.2.0

- Added support for stacked shell graphics.
- Slight graphics change to the gas vents.

Version 2.1.0

- Added new graphics for all canisters and vents introduced in the new patch.
- Doubled the resolution of all textures for Camera+ users such as myself.
- Finally got rid of that annoying white outline on all textures.
- Gas Traps are now a bit bigger.

Version 2.0.0

- Initial Release. Retextures all shells, IEDs and UI buttons.

Compatibility:

CE compatible, since it's just a retexture mod.
Multiplayer compatible, since it's just a retexture mod.
