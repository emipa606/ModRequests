To replace the Gas Traps and Vents textures, simply copy the Textures folder from here and paste it / overwrite the main Textures folder (the one where the About and Patches folders are).
To revert to normal size textures, simply unsubscribe and resubscribe / redownload this mod. These alternate textures are 33% smaller and should modify only the gas traps and vents.
