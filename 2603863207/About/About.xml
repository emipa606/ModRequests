Do you love dogs? Do you love weiner-dogs? Then this mod is for you!

When playing Rimworld, I always felt like there was a weenie shaped hole in the canine lineup. No longer! I reached out to our amazing community and commissioned this mod. 

This mod includes all three miniature dachshund coat varieties:

-Short-haired: Has a smooth coat of short, soft hair and is the most cantankerous of the three dachshund varieties.

-Long-haired: Renowned for having a silky coat and feathery tufts on its ears and legs. This pupper has the most mild disposition of the three dachshund varieties.

-Wire-haired: The least common variation of the breed. Has a thick, wiry coat and boasts the most risible attitude of the three dachshund varieties.
