  <description>This mod adds a wool item and fur harvesting property for non-lethal shepherding of guinea pigs, which everyone knows are the second cutest animal on the rim.\n\n I had a brief conversation on Reddit with Tynan a few years ago, after I had raised the fact that chinchillas live in deserts, not jungles as Rimworld spawned them, because rain would kill them. Tynan informed me that in the future, chinchillas are actually genetically modified to be much more resilient. I would imagine that whoever unf*cked their genetics would also have made them more economically useful, into an animal whose fur can be repeatedly harvested. My first mod further emphasized the entirely canon nature of genetically modified space chinchillas. \n\n But why would they have stopped there? What about the second cutest animal? This mod lets you shear wool from guinea pigs, so that you can make a nice toque to muffle their incessant squeaking.
