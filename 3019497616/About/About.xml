Credits
Huge thanks to iforgotmysocks for coding the removal designator, terrain selection logic and being all around fantastic!
Thanks to NECEROS for requesting the above and providing it to me to pull into the mod (also inviting me to the Rimworld Discord server. Thanks!)

By the way, I'm not a good texture artist. If anyone can design a better texture for the Wooden Foundation, please get in touch! Right now, it really gives meaning to the "Staggeringly Ugly" trait...
