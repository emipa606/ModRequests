	<description>	This is a lightweight patch / mod that replaces graphics for vanilla meals.
	
	coding: diannetea
	graphics: Lailani01
	
	Having been witness to my pawns exessive suffering,
	i decieded to do something nice for them!
	These meals may taste the same as the ones they are replacing,
	but they look tons better!
	
	Graphics have been replaced for:

	- Simple Meal
	- Fine Meal
	- Lavish Meal
	- Kibble
	- Pemmican
	- Survival Meal
	- Beer
	
Graphics change for all items with how big the stack is.
Exception is Food Paste (i saw no reason to do it really)
This is a lightweight patch / mod that replaces graphics for vanilla meals.
This is my first uploaded RimWorld Mod, and it started with me modding diannetea's mod "dianne's defaults - Food". You can check it out here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547263653 - diannetea was nice and granted me permission to use her original code (i really suck at programming).
	
Note that the meals will look larger with the new graphics. For instance, the meals will overlap when multiple pawns eat at 1x1 Table. Altho this doesn't bother me a bit personally, there are different tastes and some players may not like that.
	
Please give me some feedback and report any bugs.
