## Adding a column (for contributors)

1. Add a new class in Numbers\PawnColumnWorkers. Use the `Numbers` namespace. Inherit from the correct PawnColumnWorker.
1. Create a new PawnColumnDef. Save it in `1.1\Defs\PawnColumnDef\PawnColumns_Numbers.xml`. Adhere to the naming scheme there.
1. To add your new column to the Misc button, add the defName of your PawnColumnDef to the appropriate Def in `1.1\Defs\PawnColumnOptionDef\Numbers_PawnColumnOptionDef.xml`. This step should not be skipped.
1. To add your new column to the default table, add the defName of your PawnColumnDef to the approppriate PawnTableDef in `1.1\Defs\PawnTableDef\Numbers_PawnTableDef.xml`.
