  <description>Standalone version of a trait I created for use with Dragonian Prime, the trait appears about as often as undergrounder, and it allows the owner of the trait to use natural focus meditation while providing a few bonuses to psycasters. It's not terribly useful for tribals, they'll just get the stat bonuses.
