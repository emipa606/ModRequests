Cmon guys, we're almost there!
Nah, it's sleepy time. 
But the colony is literally just one hour away, and Gonzalez really needs the medicines we brought, otherwise he'll die!
Meh, when it's nap time, it's nap time.

Sounds familiar? Then this mod is for you. It adds three things buttons to your caravans: 
- An "Almost there" button - when your caravan is only x hours away from its goal, it won't stop for resting. 
- A "Never rest" button. For those that like to have their pawns suffer. 
- A "Force rest" button. Lets the caravan stop and rest immediately.
