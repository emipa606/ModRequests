  " As you watch the approaching darkness you know death has come to Rimworld..
  You turn to yell for the others.. 'RUN!' but the Darkness is already upon you.
  Only blackness and your own screams remain...you cannot escape this fate.
  The last thing you feel, before you fall into the Abyss, is your flesh being torn from your bones.
  The Darkest Night has arrived. "</description>
