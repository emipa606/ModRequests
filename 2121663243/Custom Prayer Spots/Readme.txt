To replace the prayer spots textures, simply copy the Textures folder from one of the options here and paste it / overwrite the main Textures folder (the one where the About and Patches folders are).

Description:

General - Original new texture that I made.
Inquisition - Made for Warhammer 40K (Corruption) mods.
Occult - Made for Rim Of Madness (Call Of Cthulhu) mods.
Latom - Made mostly for various medieval mods and such.
The red cross is used by the Holy Sol Temple from Fire Force. Latom!

DISCLAIMER:

Until Prayer Spots mod gets officially updated to 1.2, it will cause erros and some textures won't load on that version with the current build.
