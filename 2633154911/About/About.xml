This mod removes Ideology music from the game.

This mod is save-compatible and should be placed at the bottom of the load order.

If any music is still playing, please leave a comment on the steam page for the mod. Note when the music happened, what was happening at the time, and what your ideology is.
If possible, also include a video recording of the music occuring in your game.
