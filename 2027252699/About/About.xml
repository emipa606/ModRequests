Man-made tiles AND natural terrains no longer fade out when bordering
other terrain types - instead, they will have distinct, crisp edges. 
Natural shorelines will still be faded.

If you only want man-made terrain borders to be crisp, check out the 
No Edge Fade - Lite mod.

### Compatibility 
- Compatible with RimWorld v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, and the Royalty DLC. 
- Might be compatible with v1.3 and the Ideology DLC, but I haven't
  tested it much
- This mod hasn't been updated in a while, so there are probably bugs
- If you find any bugs, please let me know and I'll try to keep up
- There probably aren't any game-breaking incompatibilities, BUT...

This mod drastically re-orders the rendering precedence of terrains.
Floors and terrains added by other mods will probably not match this new
order.  Worst case scenario, their terrain borders might fade when they
shouldn't, or vice versa.

Good news, though: This mod can be easily updated to fix these issues.
Please feel free to make a compatibility request for any mods you like.

### Known Issues
Rough, hewn, and smooth stone floors are hard-coded and can't be
modified by XML.  As a result, they may have some faded borders.

### Notes
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just changes the renderPrecedence
  and edgeType of terrains.
