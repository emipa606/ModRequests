# No Edge Fade
A RimWorld mod:

Man-made tiles AND natural terrains no longer fade out when bordering
other terrain types - instead, they will have distinct, crisp edges. 
Natural shorelines will still be faded.

If you only want man-made terrain borders to be crisp, check out the 
No Edge Fade - Lite mod.

### Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld **v1.0**, **v1.1**, **v1.2**, and the **Royalty** DLC.
- Might be compatible with **v1.3** and the **Ideology** DLC, but I haven't
  tested it much
- This mod hasn't been updated in a while, so there are probably bugs
- If you find any bugs, please let me know and I'll try to keep up
- There probably aren't any game-breaking incompatibilities, **BUT...**

This mod drastically re-orders the rendering precedence of terrains.
Floors and terrains added by other mods will probably not match this new
order.  Worst case scenario, their terrain borders might fade when they
shouldn't, or vice versa.

Good news, though: This mod can be easily updated to fix these issues.
Please feel free to make a compatibility request for any mods you like.
