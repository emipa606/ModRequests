  <description>When you build new Scenarios, you want to tell as story. But apart from the message popping up during the GameStartDialog, there is simply no way. I think, the *why* a raid is coming for me or *why* the sun will never rise above my head again is the backbone of that story.
This mod will give the scenario builders a new part called "Letter" that they can use to send the player letters at key moments of his story and give them some much deserved depth.
    
This mod is very lightweight with no dependencies and poses no alterations to the base game and is compatible to all other mods. English and German is supported.
    
This mod must be installed both by the scenario builder and player.
Uninstalling the mod during a playthrough is not advised.</description>
