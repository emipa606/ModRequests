	<description>Rimcraft Animals, a fantasy animal mod based upon World of Warcraft.

This mod is a sub-mod for Rimcraft, and adds lore specific animals to Rimworld. It can be used either by itself or along with Rimcraft and has patched in functionality to allow for full integration with it.

Feature Overview
  -  New WoW specific creatures such as Direwolves, Hawkstriders, Raptors, and many others.

This mod is very much a work in progress, with the intent to add more animals and creatures that fit within the Warcraft universe. Constructive criticism, suggestions, and ideas are very much appreciated.

For more information or if you're interested in helping with the project, feel free to check out our discord if you have a personal question for me about the mod, or post pictures related to the mod. https://discord.gg/3Dp7Zug
