    <content>Mod Manager was updated for RimWorld 1.2, with a number of improvements and bugfixes;
      - user data (e.g. mod colours) should no longer randomly reset
      - Mod Manager should be much more response for large mod lists
      - You can again create multiple local copies for backups
      - CrossPromotion preview images can now be cached in the system temp dir
      - CrossPromotion cache can be cleared by the user (see the mod settings)

      |Some issues still remain;
      - Importing pre-1.1 modlists works unreliably (will likely not be fixed anymore).
      - (Mass) subscribing to missing steam mods is not yet hooked up.
      - The auto-sort button does not work correctly. 
      - And a variety of other small issues. 

      |I'm working on getting all the pre-1.1 features back up and running, and some generous volunteers and I are working on what will be the next stage for Mod Manager. You'll hear more about where Mod Manager is going, and how you can have a say in the process, soonâ„¢.
