    <description>During many years of fighting with the ancient Heavenly Soldiers and Machine Races, the colonists of China discovered that these Heavenly Soldiers and Machine Races had restored some beasts that originally only existed in the mythology of China through genetic engineering, and these beasts frequently appeared after being created. Launch an attack on the rich colonies in the fringe world, and fortunately, some Chinese colonies have killed some Chinese beasts and kept some corpse samples. I believe that it only needs to invest some high-tech research resources to quickly unravel the mystery of the genes of these beasts. \n\nThrough research on the whereabouts of the beasts, their living habits, and some collected DNA samples, the ability to extract the genes of the beasts in China will be unlocked. \n\n (It is necessary to keep the corpse after killing the beast and then extract the corresponding gene in the gene extractor)</description>
