	<description>Have you been waiting years and years for your brother-in-law to show up and he just walks past, just to be never seen again? Plot twist!

One Big Family solves this problem by changing the odds! Everyone is related... somehow, right!?

That spacer you found in a 2000 year old casket? Plot twist! Turns out to be the son you never knew of! 
Just settled down, built a little house with your wife and kids? Plot twist! Your step-mother comes on a visit with your secret lover who is also your wife's daughter to sell you dog meat!
Getting raided by a horde of savages? Plot twist! They brought their whole family tree, including your evil sister who turns out to be their leader AND grand mother!

After all, we're now One Big Family!

Instructions:
You can customize this mod in the mod options. This mod changes what happens when a new pawn is created (existing pawns are only affected passively). 
The new pawn will receive a random amount of relationships that are "plausible" according to vanilla rules. The relationships will be with other pawns. If you have "allow colonists" on, these can be your pawns as well.
