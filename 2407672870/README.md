# Entomophagy
Eat Bugs Yum

Adds "insect" versions of vanilla meals and Vanilla Cooking Expanded foods. You can decide whether the new textures appear automatically when cooking with insect meat, whether to add specific insect-meal bills to cooking stations (restart required), both, or neither.

Adds an entomophagous (bug eater) trait. Pawns with this trait enjoy eating bugs and gain a positive mood thought from eating insect meat. Entomophagous pawns can have a random mental break in which they will randomly forage for bugs for ~1 to ~2 hours, gaining a small amount of food. Entomophagous pawns are much more likely to forage when hungry, but they won't forage when drafted, hurt, in bad weather, or if they've recently foraged or eaten insect meat. Pawns will also stop foraging if they are hurt or the weather turns bad. 

As a result of their special mental break, entomophagous pawns are much less likely starve. However, foraging is a very inefficent use of time and causes a slight negative social opinion in others. You can prevent entomophagous meals from foraging by providing them a steady diet of insect meals.

(Requires Universal Fermenter): A new bug hotel and bug condo provides a method for converting raw plant food into insect meat. The condo is more efficient and produces insect meat more often.
