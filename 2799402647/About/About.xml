	<description>Adds in a fancy new helmet, that is obscenely heavy, and rather uncomfortable to wear. Those wearing it will have their movement slowed, and sight limited, and the weight of the helmet will inflict a small amount of pain. Slaves wearing it will have their suppression increased, making them less likely to rebel.\n\n- Art bu Kropolis\n- xml by SirMashedPotato\n- Oversized weapons comp by Jecrell\n- Based on Pyramid Head from the hit video-game Silent Hill 2, by Team Silent.
