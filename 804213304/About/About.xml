  <description>This is an Extreme version of Destroyed City that I will use for maximum clutter and structures. There is little fertile land and mostly rubble. I call this a beta because I will experiment with many of the core textures and objects in Rim World. This beta may not be compatible with some mods or saves and will be used to test features that will alter the game experience. This is a safe way for me to make drastic changes with the goal of making Destroyed City even better</description>
