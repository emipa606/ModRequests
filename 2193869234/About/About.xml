	<description>Adds some new storytellers. The "Hybrid" storyteller adds some of Randy's chaos into Phoebe's relaxed storytelling, while the "Clustered Hybrid" storyteller has a love of sending multi-faction raids, extra reinforcements, and extra neutral visitors, traders, and passer bys. All storytellers have a slight bias towards a higher early game population and more miscellaneous events.
