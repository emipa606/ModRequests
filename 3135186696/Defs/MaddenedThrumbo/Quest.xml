                <li>questDescription->Someone from a tribal village has heard that you were looking for [relic_name]. They've come across some information of its whereabouts and are offering it you, but they're currently preparing for an attack from some nearby Manhunting Thrumbos. If help them defend their village against the Thrumbos, they'll share their information with you.\n\nIf you do accept, they think they'll be able to hold off the Thrumbos for about [timer_duration], but no longer. Be prepared to go in hard and fast for if your contact dies then they won't be able to tell you what they know.</li>
