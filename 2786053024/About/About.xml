  <description>This mod allows you to automatically grow crops in a specialised automatic hydroponic. Just select the crop you wish to grow and the garden Cloche will automatically spawn the grown resources.

The Cloche grows crops about twice as fast as growning in soil since the crop will grow both day and night. Although power conumption is 100W double the hydroponic.

It is possible to use tune the cloche so it produces more crops at a faster rate at the expense of power draw</description>
