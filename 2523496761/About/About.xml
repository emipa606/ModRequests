	<description>Are you struggling to grow the funny red mushroom in your frozen hellscape of a biome? Are you tired of shorting out your dying grandmother's life support because those sun lamps just take up too much power? "There's got to be a better way!" Introducing... devilstrand animals! They're animals that have been gene engineered to produce devilstrand when milked. Go look up spider goats. It's like that. Do not eat. Enjoy.</description>
