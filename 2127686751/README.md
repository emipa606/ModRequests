# General information

This is an unofficial update of PhileasFogg's mod which can be found on the [Ludeon Forums](url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34214.msg349406)

# Feature overview

## Installation of new bodyparts (third eye, more arms, supporting organ parts, etc.) and some experimental brain surgery
Harvested bodyparts and organs can now be installed at "unusual" places (for example as a third leg). But as your pawns bodies and brains aren't prepaired for this, their benefits are limited.

## Harvesting of mechanoid bodyparts for simple prosthetics
You can now harvest more than blades from scythers. You can get light rezeptors, simple prosthetic arms, hands, legs and feet, artificial noses, brain stimulators and centipede tails. Some of these parts can be recived from both mechanoid versions, some only from scythers (like blades), others only from centipedes (like centipede tails).
