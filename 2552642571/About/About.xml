New melee attacks 

Pawns will now perform other melee attacks besides punching with their fists. This includes: 

-Striking with their palm heel (hand).

-Pushing people to stun them (arms).

-Scratching with their nails (fingers). 

-Biting people (increased chance of happening).

-Bashing somebody with their own head (-||-). 

-Hitting with their elbow (arm) or a knee (leg).

-Kicking
  

All vanilla prosthetics, that should have a melee attack now have one, including the peg leg and the denture.

Combat Extended is incompatible with CQC Brutality, use CQC Brutality -patch instead.
