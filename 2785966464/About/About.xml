A retexture of the vanilla dryads, to make them look like real barky tree people!
I saw Wolf478's retexture mod and thought the idea was really cool, but they didn't really fit in my highly-modded game aesthetic, so I spent a couple days making my own cute dryads girls and guys.

I might make an anima reskin or vanilla expanded types later if people are interested, I don't use them personally so I haven't bothered including them in here.

Feel free to use, change, or include these sprites in your own mods, addons, or anything else. Please don't ask for permission!
