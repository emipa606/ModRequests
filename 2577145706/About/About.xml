		<description>Do you want a robotic race that is both balanced and challenging? Do you enjoy vanilla rooted aesthetics and descriptions, ignoring the effects of acid and toxicity, being hated by technophobic zealots, and the inability to eat or sleep? Then this mod may just be for you!\n\nRim-Skeletons is a very lightweight mod that does its best to add a new race of robots seamlessly into the vanilla setting of Rimworld. 'Skeletons' are described in their info tab as being a race of "proto-mechanical persona", being the precursors to the mechanoids and AI persona we all know and love. Their spawning is also very unique; instead of having a faction they spawn alongside outlander and spacer factions, albeit their spawn rate is extraordinarily rare - this way you cannot quickly and easily amass a army of robotic overlords. There is no apparel, weaponry, factions, or items added in this mod. The race itself originates from the game "Kenshi" by Lo-Fi games.Skeletons are a rather unique race of robots, instead of having one central faction they instead can be found very rarely amongst pawns with the faction tech levels of industrial and spacer. They share quite a few stats with vanilla mechanoids, such as heat armor, temperature immunity, fire resistance, toxic fallout immunity, and the fact that they do not need food or sleep.\n\nThey do however have an increased chance to spawn with the "depressive" or "pessimistic" traits due to their often sad and lonely lives. However they can still be affected by pain shock, psychic drones, psycasts, and drug addictions.</description>
