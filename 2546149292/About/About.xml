	<description>Adds zone option to cut all the plants as soon as they sprout.

Right-click "Cut everything" designator icon for more options:

- Cut everything: keep the ground bare
- Cut all cover: remove anything that can be used as cover, like trees and bushes
- Cut all wind blockers: remove any plants that can block wind turbines

An additional option is available for >=1.3 game version to disallow cutting trees, configurable per-zone.

This mod won't cut plants that are not auto-harvestable (like bonsai tree in Ideology) unless forced.
This is consistent with the game's work job implementation. If you think the mod should cut them too, let me know the reason and I will consider it.

Compatibility:
- Compatible with any mod that adds plants or trees
- Can be added or removed from the game whenever (you will see a few errors about missing defs, but saving the game and then loading again will fix that)
