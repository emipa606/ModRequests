  <!-- This hediff is meant to be an indirect replacement for the
       deathOnFailedSurgeryChance property of recipes (surgeries). That effect,
       when it triggers, simply kills the, and the pawn has no way to interrupt
       or stop the effect. A deathless pawn, however, should not... just die.

       This hediff gets around that in a slightly clumsy way. First, it is
       always immediately lethal, as the lethal severity is 1. Non-deathless
       pawns will immediately die, though they will still have this hediff. But
       they're dead, so it doesn't really make a difference.

       A deathless pawn will also first get this hediff, which will cause them
       to immediately start deathresting or go into a regenerative coma.
       However, because this hediff is lethal and is still applied to the pawn,
       their timer for exiting deathrest or the regenerative coma does not
       start. Which means they'll never wake up again.

       To get around this, I set the one and only stage for this hediff to
       destroy the part it is affecting. With the part destroyed, the hediff
       goes away, and thus the deathless pawn will eventually wake up again. If
       the affected part is required for living (e.g., their heart), the pawn
       will not wake up until the part is restored. Which is a pain, but not as
       much of a pain as the pawn... just dying.

       As an added bonus, if the affected part is the neck/head/brain, the
       deathless *will*... just die. Because that's how deathless pawns die. So
       there's still a chance!

       To handle the case where the surgery did not affect a specific body
       part, this hediff disappears after a short while. For pawns that die, it
       will not disappear and the effect is unchanged. For deathless pawns,
       when the hediff disappears, they will be able to then start their
       countdown timer for waking up from their deathrest or regenerative coma
       (assuming nothing else would prevent that).

       If the affected pawn is later resurrected, the resurrection process
       removes this hediff, so it will not, for example, immediately kill them
       again. (This was tested with resurrector mech serums, so it is possible
       other methods of resurrection might not remove it, needing additional
       handling.)
