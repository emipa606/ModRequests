[h1]Sanguophage Tweaks - v0.5.0[/h1]

[h2]About[/h2]
This mod makes a number of small[ish] tweaks to how Sanguophages behave, and it also includes a few bits of new content.  Since it deals with Sanguophages, the Biotech DLC is a hard requirement. Any other mods that this mod patches to or adds content for are all optional; the features are only enabled when the dependent mods are present.

With that said, many of the changes relate to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963116383]Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage[/url] (VRES), so not also using that mod is almost a silly idea.

There is a surprisingly small amount of space available for mod descriptions here, so please refer to the README.md and ANALYSIS.md files (included with the mod and available on the mod's GitHub repo) for more information about the features, thought processes that led to this mod's creation, details regarding numerical changes, and more potential future plans.

[h2]Features[/h2]
The mod features are categorized by the mod they primarily modify or affect.

[h3]Core[/h3]
[list]
    [*]Surgeries that have a chance to immediately kill the pawn on failure now instead apply a "fatal surgery mishap" hediff, allowing deathless pawns the opportunity to enter deathrest or a regenerative coma.
[/list]

[h3]Biotech[/h3]
[list]
    [*]Modify the amount of hemogen a pawn gains or loses by its body size (larger pawns gain less, smaller pawns gain more).[list]
    [*]The effect of body size caps at body sizes of 0.2 and 10.
    [*]Examples hemogen change modifiers:[list]
    [*]Body size 0.8: 1.25x   (25% more)
    [*]Body size 6.5: ~0.15x  (15% as much)
[/list] [/list]
    [*]The amount of hemogen a Sanguophage gains from feeding on a pawn is no longer modified by the body size of the victim. VRES, with its animal feeding, introduced the idea of the victim losing an amount of blood being modified by its body size, which implies the volume of blood extracted by the Sanguophage is constant. I like this interpretation better than vanilla's, which implies a Sanguophage always drinks a specific percentage of a pawn's blood.[list]
    [*]Note that this change makes it harder for Sanguophages to fill up on hemogen, but in vanilla Sanguophages can not feed on animals nor are there many pawns with a larger body size (or a much larger body size), so its effect is minimal. With, for example, mods that add genes to modify a human pawn's body size in either direction, or when using VRE - S to feed on animals, this change will have much more of an effect. [/list]
    [*]A pawn that is incapable of violence will not be able to feed on a pawn who would then have life threatening or lethal blood loss.[list]
    [*]For now, this does [i]not[/i] take into account body size of the target, as I want it to match as closely as possible to when a confirmation box would appear for causing life threatening or lethal blood loss (a vanilla feature).
    [*]This also only applies to "normal" bloodfeeding, not for feeding on animals or sanguophages (or corpses, but, well...). [/list]
    [*]Add a concept of "hemogen concentration", based on how much hemogen and blood loss a pawn has.
    [*]A hemogenic pawn that is bleeding will now also lose hemogen, proportional to their hemogen concentration and bleed rate.[list]
    [*]This feature can be disabled in the mod settings.
[/list] [/list]

[h3]Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage[/h3]
[list]
    [*]Add a recipe to perform a blood transfusion to animals using animal hemogen.[list]
    [*]The amount of blood gained is modified by the body size of the animal.
    [*]The label for the operation will indicate how much blood will be restored per pack. [/list]
    [*]Add a recipe to extract an animal hemogen pack from an animal.[list]
    [*]The amount of blood lost is modified by the body size of the animal.
    [*]The label for the operation will indicate the maximum amount of blood that will be lost.[list]
    [*]Note that the vanilla operation to extract a hemogen pack from a human has a computation based on what medicine is being used to determine how much blood is lost, but the operation does not actually use any medicine!  For consistency, the corresponding operation for animals behaves the same way, but I want to modify both to either not include that calculation or actually require medicine (requiring it would make the easier availability of animal hemogen more balanced). [/list] [/list] [/list]

[h2]Notes and Future Ideas[/h2]
Hm... well, while inspecting all the kinds of bloodfeeders we have now (with VRES), we've got a bunch, yeah, but there are some obvious gaps. Insect feeders?  Mechanoid feeders?

The analysis file also includes more details on features not implemented yet.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
None.

[h2]Adding and Removing the Mod[/h2]
Adding this mod to an existing save is fine.

For removing it, I expect you could get some one-time errors, and I would recommend not having any of this mod's operations queued up or in progress when you do so. Otherwise, it should be fine.

[h2]Reporting Issues[/h2]
Please follow the typical RimWorld modding conventions for error reporting.

[list]
    [*]Determine the minimal set of mods that are necessary to recreate the issue.
    [*]Provide the log file with the error, preferably using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=818773962]HugsLib's[/url] Ctrl+F12 feature.
    [*]Also include a description of what went wrong and what led up to the error (in as much detail as you can as the medium allows). [/list]

Please post these error reports to the Steam workshop comments (most convenient for you but does not give much room for detail), in a bug reporting discussion thread (if one exists), or as a GitHub issue (allows for the most comprehensive disussion and documentation).

I reserve the right to ignore any error reports which do not follow these steps, especially if no error is provided or the log has many, many mods in use.

[h2]"[KOM]"? What's that?[/h2]
"KOM" is an abbreviation for Komishne, another name I often go by online.  It is also the name I typically use as a personal identifier in code, such as in namespaces (in lieu of a company name). "[KOM]", then, is used as a mod name prefix to identify they are mods I have made.
