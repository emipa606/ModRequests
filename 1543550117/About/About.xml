  <description>Expands the game's cloth system.

● Cotton plants now produce fibre when harvested instead of cloth
● Adds a cotton processing research topic that unlocks a new workshop, the textile bench
● The textile bench lets your colonists process fibre into cloth
● Padded sleeping spots can be built with fibre

Players who use this mod in conjunction with [T] MoreBedsCloth will find that this makes the early game more challenging as you can't build beds right away. There are a couple of ways to cope:

Grow and harvest some cotton as quickly as possible in order to build padded sleeping spots as a stop-gap while you research cotton processing, or edit your starting scenario so that it starts you with enough cloth to build beds for your starting colonist(s). You need 12 cloth for a normal bed, 18 for a double, and 24 for a royal.
