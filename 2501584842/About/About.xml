  This mod rebalances the Argonians of Blackmarsh (Continued) mod, made by Mlie, which itself is an update of Helixien and Xens Argonians of Blackmarsh. This mod is just a bunch of minor changes to the mod, most of the credit should go to them.
  
  Visual Changes:

- Changed blood color from green to the default red, (In the games, Argonians have always had the same blood color as all races)

- Fixed the female argonian face being slightly off center

- Added female normal and wide faces

  Stat Changes:

- Argonians can't withstand the cold as well as other races now

- Unhanded attacks now deal cutting damage, thanks to their claws

- Changed mining speed from 300% to 130% (The original value is way too overpowered)

- Changed research speed from 200% to the normal value of 100% (Because Argonians don't necessarily excel at magic in the games, and the original value was too overpowered)

- Argonians now build up immunities 40% faster than other races (To reflect their immunity to diseases)

- Agonians now move faster than other races (To reflect their higher speed stat from Morrowind and Oblivion)

- Argonians now have a higher melee dodge chance than other races and are less likely to activate traps (To reflect their higher agility stat from Morrowind and Oblivion)

- Argonians now only rest at 70% efficiency compared to other races, meaning they need to rest for longer (Not necessarily based on anything, just an attempt at nerfing them a bit)

- Argonians now negotiate with only 70% efficiency and have a lower Social Impact (To reflect their lower personality from Morrowind and Oblivion)

  Misc. Changes:

- Argonians can now recieve the negative moods from seeing corpses, eating raw food and eating humanlike meat (Not sure why this wasn't the case in the original mod)

- Changed the description of Argonian leather to say they're from Argonians rather than humans

- Changed the armor values of Argonian leather to be in line with Lizardskin rather than human leather
