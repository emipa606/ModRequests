        <description>Until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, rails were made of wood, were a few inches wide and were fastened end to end, on logs of wood or "sleepers". In time, it became common to cover them with a thin flat plating of iron to add to their life and reduce friction. This caused more wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons and towards the middle of the 18th century, led to the introduction of iron wheels. However, the iron plating was not strong enough to resist buckling under the passage of the loaded wagons, so rails made wholly of iron were invented.</description>
