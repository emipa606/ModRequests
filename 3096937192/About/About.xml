	<description>What is RIMSPR? Well, it's a lot like CRISPR but instead of standing for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, it stands for something else entirely.

With the RIMSPR lab, no more will you be subject to the fickle whims of Randy in your quest to design the perfect xenotype. Now you can select any gene you desire and your researchers will work to isolate and manufacture a genepack for that specific gene, and all it will cost you is some neutroamine, a ton of chemfuel, your colony’s entire food stockpile, and a few years of your researcher’s life!</description>
