An evolution of barbed wire, concertina wire is named for its helical shape and tendency to expand—resembling a musical instrument of the same name. A cheap, lightweight building material used to construct formiable anti-infantry obstacles and fortifications.

It is generally made of two wires, a stronger, un-barbed support wire and a length of razor tape with sharp, pointed barbs produced in several different lengths. The result is a self-supporting wire structure that can quickly be deployed to create a formidable obstacle to infantry. Faster to deploy than a traditional wire-and-stake fence and simple to manufacture on an industrial scale, its low cost and lightweight make it ideal for fortifications and portable field defenses.
