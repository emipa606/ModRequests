With this Patch Astoriel is compatible with [NL] Facial Animation - WIP. It adds extra ears and heads (without human ears) so you can see if a pawn looses an ear.

Male pawns can have three, female pawns two different face types. But unfortunatly you can't choose them with the Character Editor. You have to randomize your pawn until you get the desired face type and then set the rest.

For an existing savegame you have to do it the same way. You can randomize only the appearence of the pawn (the stats stay the same) until you get the desired face type.

This Patch is also compatible with "Nals Facial Animation for HAR" by Daemon976. Load this patch afterwards.
