	<description>
Break construction tasks into logical sub-units.

Breaks up and modifies the Construction work type in the following manner:
• Moves repairing tasks to a new work type called Repair
• Moves deconstruction tasks to a new work type called Deconstruct.
• Adds a work type called Deliver that commands pawns to deliver resources to construction projects¹

1: These are not moved out of the Construction work type so a pawn set to construct will also deliver items to construction projects as needed as well.
