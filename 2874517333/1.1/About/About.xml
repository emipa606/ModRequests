This is an unofficial update to Turtle Friendly Raids so that it works with 1.4

Mod will be taken down if requested by the original author. 

This mod prevents stock raids from spawning via drop pod, and disables stock sappers.

All other stock raids will spawn by walking in from the map edge, possibly in groups.
    
This mod is intended for players who'd like to turtle up in their base without getting their day ruined by raiders digging through the mountain-side or landing behind their defenses.

Specifically, this mod disables all arrival modes except "EdgeWalkIn" and "EdgeWalkInGroups" for all vanilla raid strategies, and sets the selection chance for sappers to zero.

This mod does NOT:
    1) Disable infestations.
    2) Disable crashed ship parts.
    3) Disable sieges.
    4) Disable resupply drop pods for sieges.
    5) Prevent you from using drop pods to raid other factions.
    6) Add turtles to the game.
    7) Make stock tortoises immortal.

You should be able to add and remove this mod from existing save games without any issues.
This mod may conflict with other mods that add new raid types, but I'm not aware of any incompatibilities at the time of writing.
This mod should be placed last (or close to last) in the mod load order, as other mods may overwrite the changes this mod makes.

KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:
    None at the moment
