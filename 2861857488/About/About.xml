		<description>A mod that tries to add interesting new floor options to the rather few the basegame contains. It adds a variety of grounds to walk on, featuring wood-, stone-, concrete-, chem- and plastic floors for you to explore and build with. Will feature additional ones as I make them! Enjoy!</description>
