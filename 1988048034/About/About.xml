  <description>Beef Eaters say, Where's The Beef?
  
  Version 1.1
  
  This MOD adds two animal races, the Pygmy Beefalo, and the Belgian Blue Cow.
  
  Belgian Blue Cows - These animals have been bred to create rediculously huge cows that produce massive amounts of milk and meat. They are huge yet very docile.
  
  Beefalo - For eons Rim Fella have been specifically breeding this animal for their own benefit. Smaller than Cows and Muffalos the cross between them has produced what one could only call a very intelligent Pygmy with exceptional litter sizes compared to that of pigs. It's half the size of a cow with the flavorfull meat of beef, and the beautiful warming wool of muffalo. With both genders having horns and being able to haul and fight, Animal Armor was needed.
  
  Requires Animal gear to be loaded before this mod.
  NOTE: You can run without Animal Gear. it only loads the def if you have the MOD active.
  
  Version 1.0 - Release
  Version 1.1 - Updated to 1.4 and renamed Beef Eaters from Where's The Beef.
