	<description>Boosts the Transport pods range and cap.

* Increases range up to around 222 tiles from 66 tiles.
(500 units of max fuel with 100 units of fuel preset upon construction.)
* Increases their storage cap to 500kg from 150kg. (Half a ton.)
* Building size reduced to 1x1 from 1x2
(Pods also got their gfx size reduced by around ~15%)

Enjoy - I sure do.

Uses the patch system so if loaded early, 99.99% compatible with any other mod.
Safe to add mid-game, and
Safe to remove mid-game, but deconstruct any pods/launchers before uninstalling mod!
