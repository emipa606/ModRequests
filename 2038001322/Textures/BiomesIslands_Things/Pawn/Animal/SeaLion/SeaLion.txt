How big is it? About pawn sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Eats smaller prey.
Where does it live? Temperate to cool islands.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Decent but not great leather. Fully trainable. Faster in the water, slower on land.
