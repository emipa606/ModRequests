	WHAT IS IT?
	This mod is the core mod, first and main of the "Mechalite" mod series. It adds more diversity to the game by adding new materials, items, buildings and technologies. The gameplay will become more intresting, and you will have more things to do before leaving the planet.
	Mod is compatible with old saves.
	Mod is compatible with EPOE/RBSE and should not conflict with other mods.
	It is recommended to also install DeCore mod, its metal rebalance features will work nicely with Mechalite Core.
	New resources are more likely to be found in other settlements, in bulk goods(not tribal) and exotic goods trader's stock. Mecha prosthetics can be bought only from orbital traders (to prevent easy obtainment through caravan robbery).
