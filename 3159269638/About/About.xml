	<description>This is a forked version of SeedsPlease Lite mod. Includes various changes:
1. Names of auto-generated seeds are now based on the plants name instead of its internal defName, allowing for proper name for seeds for various mods such as Medieval Overhaul.
2. Description of auto-generated or predefined seeds is now based on the plants' description. Now there is also a link to the plant and its product in the seed's info page.
3. Extracting seeds from plants that produce less harvest will now result in more seeds.
4. Stack size of seeds has been increased to 1000, to reduce micro-management of their storage.</description>
