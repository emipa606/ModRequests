		<helpText>Dual wielding doesn't come without penalties. Both the cooldown time (time a pawn can't do anything after taking a shot), and the shooting accuracy get a penalty that is configurable in the mod settings. This penalty depends heavily on the skill (melee for melee weapons, and shooting for ranged weapons) of the pawn. Letting you lvl 1 shooting skill pawn dual wield guns might not be such a good idea!</helpText>
