    <![CDATA[Make wedding and pet getting hunted a letter instead of just a message.

FAQ:

# Is it safe to add mid-game?

Yes. However do keep in mind that:
Events such as marriage prior to to this mod will stay as messages!
Only message that signify the start, such as "Colonists are gathering to celebrate" message will be turned into letter!
Subsequent message after start of event will stay as message! ie beginning marriage, ceremony called off etc will still be messages

Thus, starting on a new save is recommended!

# Is it safe to remove mid-game?

Yes

Technical Detail:

You can also make any message into a letter! But be careful
which translation key is used by:

```xml
<IncidentDef ParentName="E1D8_IncidentBase">
  <defName>E1D8_MessageNewMarriageCeremony</defName>
  <label>New Marriage Ceremony!</label>
  <letterLabel>New Marriage Ceremony!</letterLabel>
  <letterDef>PositiveEvent</letterDef>
  <modExtensions>
    <li Class="Message2Letter.ModExtension_OnTranslationKey">
      <eventKeyList>
        <!-- Translation Key to watch out for -->
        <li>MessageNewMarriageCeremony</li>
      </eventKeyList>
    </li>
  </modExtensions>
</IncidentDef>
```
