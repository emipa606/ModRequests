  <description>The AutoClean Floors are always clean, you'll don't have to worry about cleanliness again.

General
 • Add: AutoClean Floor and AutoClean Carpet. They never get filth or snow (seriously!).
 • Actually when you build it, you have to clean the dirt once. But it's just one time.
 • These floors are late-game oriented. I'm considering making a lite version.

AutoClean Floor
 • Never get filth or snow. Neutral beautiness.

AutoClean Carpet
 • Never get filth or snow. Very beauty, speed bonus.
 
Compatibilities
 • Compatible with other mods and existent saves.
