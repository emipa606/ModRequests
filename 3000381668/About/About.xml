The Jelano retexture series aims to improve textures both from the original game and from community mods.

This mod retextures the elements from Vanilla outposts expanded mod by Oskar Potocki, legodude17, Kikohi and Chowder. I made some of the outposts textures images more minimalistic.

A also redraw textures from other outposts mods by MrHydralisk

I would appreciate your support on Patreon. Have a good day
