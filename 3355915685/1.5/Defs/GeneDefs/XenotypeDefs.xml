		<description>Elysians are archotech-enhanced xenohumans temporally linked to the pocket dimension of Elysium. With ectoplasm, they can phase between ethereal and corporeal forms. In the event of death, they will skip back to their pocket dimension and will return after some time has passed.\n\nElysium was once a moon undergoing transcendence until a spacetime anomaly caused it's disappearance. The few Elysians that survived the event found themselves forever altered and trapped in the newly formed pocket dimension. Reborn with their new powers they began casting themselves out into the stars.</description>
