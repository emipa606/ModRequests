  <description>Scientists on a frigid glitterworld combined elephant and muffalo DNA along with a sample obtained from a long extinct prehistoric Earth mammal to revive the ancient species.  The muffalant is perfectly suited for frigid planets, and its uniquely evolved hemoglobin, durable hide, and slow growing fur keeps it warm in even the coldest of temperatures.  Although this large herding herbivore is typically peaceful, the muffalant will fiercely defend itself when attacked.
