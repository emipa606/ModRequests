		<description>The Aetas Serum (ADR-13), like the Inertia drug, is a specially engineered formula designed to modify the Metroid genome. However, instead of stopping the metroids from maturing, it actually accelerates the process; metroids injected with this serum will undergo rapid cellular growth, undergoing changes that would otherwise take decades. however, the process is slow, and may take a couple days to thoroughly complete. \n\nLike all other metroid-specific drugs, this is essentially a poison to anything else; non-lethal, but it will incapacitate other organisms for a significant amount of time.</description>

  <!--Notes on Aetas:
  Name is not final. The formula on figuring out aging is a bit complicated.
  First comes how long the hediff will be present. The older the metroid, the longer the hediff.
  By default a bantee takes 1.8 days. This increases by .1 every stage.
  Second comes the age amount. This will 20 or 25% of the age needed for the next stage
  Then, you need to subtract the previous stage age requirement so the percentage is accurate.
  Finally this needs to be calcuated so that each tick adds up to the desired age increase
  Once genetic equipment is added, this will be done much faster, from 16~24 hours.

  For 5 years, (3,600,000 * 5) / <disappearsAfterTicks> gives you the <ticks> value you need.
  1 day = 60,000 ticks
  1 year = 	3,600,000	
  
  Age durations are as follows:
  Bantee: 1.8 days for 25% increase (3.6 years added; evolves 14 years later)
  Larvae: 2 days for 25% increase (16.5 years added; evolves 66 years later)
  Alpha: 2.2 days for 25% increase (33.5 years added; evolves 134 years)
  Gamma: 2.4 days for 20% increase (50 years added; evolves 250 years later)
  Zeta: 2.6 days for 20% increase (90 years added; evolved 450 years later)
  Omega: 2.8 days for an additional 200 years
  Queen: 3 days for an additional 550 years
  
  So the formula is (Bantee for example):
  
  60,000 (ticks per day) x 1.8 (hediff day duration) = 108000 (total ticks hediff lasts; goes in <disappearsAfterTicks>)
  3,600,000 (ticks in year) x 3.6 (years added) = 12,960,000 (total given ticks)
  12,960,000 (total given ticks) / 108000 (total ticks hediff lasts) = 120 (final tick amount)
  So in the end, the <ticks> tag needs to have 120

  Round values up or down; for example, Alpha <ticks> tag ends up at 913.63636363; that is pushed up to 914-->
