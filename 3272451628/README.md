Adds a "Sentient" hediff in the brain that animals can very rarely randomly spawn with in the wild, or can be added with surgery by a highly skilled surgeon. 



- Animals with the sentient hediff can do jobs like hauling, cleaning, nursing.
- They are always 100% trained with the most advanced training level, and their training never degrades.
- They have the ability to talk.
- Sentient is passed on 100% if both parents are sentient, or 1/4th of a chance if only one is sentient.
- They're draftable
