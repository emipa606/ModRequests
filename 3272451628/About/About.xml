Adds a "Sentient" hediff in the brain that animals can very rarely randomly spawn with in the wild, or can be added with surgery by a highly skilled surgeon. 

[list]
[*]Animals with the sentient hediff can do jobs like hauling, cleaning, nursing.
[*]They are always 100% trained with the most advanced training level, and their training never degrades.
[*]They have the ability to talk.
[*]Sentient is passed on 100% if both parents are sentient, or 1/4th of a chance if only one is sentient.
[*]They're draftable
