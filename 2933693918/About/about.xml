    <description>Tired of slurping hemogen out of plastic bags like uncultured animals?\n\nThis mod uses systems introduced by other mods such as Vanilla Cooking Expanded to add five new types of hemogen-based food and drink for your Sanguophages to dine on (They're also a way to make hemogen palatable for non-Sanguophages too!). You'll lose a little bit of hemogen in the process, but your Sanguophages will thank you greatly.\n\nWith Vanilla Cooking Expanded and its Stews module, you'll be able to make Hemogen Soup and Stew, which fill almost twice as much hemogen as a hemogen pack and count as fine meals. You can also create Hemogen Biscuits using flour, which never go bad and fill both joy and hemogen.\n\nVanilla Brewing Expanded introduces Hemogen Soda, which fills the hemogen need while granting the effects of a regular soda.\n\nFinally, with Arg√≥n's Salted Meat 2.0, you'll be able to make Hemogen Sausages, which function like regular sausages but don't require as much meat in their recipe.</description>
