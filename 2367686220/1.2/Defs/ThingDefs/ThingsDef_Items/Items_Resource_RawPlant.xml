		<label>Clossom Claws</label>
		<description>Strange, seasoned claws, harvested from the clossom plant. It's strangely delicous flavor combined with it's almost ground beef-like texture and a satisfying crunch make many consider this the "Space Taco", which makes it ideal for savy managers looking to cut costs on prepared food, mainly by telling employees to throw the claw in the microwave.

It has been observed that the blue spikes that line the claws can be ground and sprinkled over food, giving it an excellent amount of flavor. Usually, amateurs in Clossom-inary arts disregard them along with a good deal of the crunchy shell. The true crunch in the shell comes from boiling the shell in a vat of mysterious goo, usually a strongly aromatic and acidic goo, though a much less satisfying crunch comes from simply just boiling the shells.</description>
