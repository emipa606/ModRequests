	<description>Have you ever wondered to yourself, "Well, if a space trucker gets to eat free ground tacos or delicously delactable fruity things, then my employees should too!". Well, this mod is for that specific feeling. This mod adds in the ability to plant several different organisms originally native to a strange, continent sized organism called the "Bawg". This is a crashlands inspired mod, and was a passion project that took a few days, mainly in the art assets.
	
This mod adds in the new "plants," the first of which is a strange claw-agave like organism that's called a Clossom, and can be planted in a pot. Second, but last for now, is the Tusker, a small parasite that's been genetically modified to survive outside the bawg. Both of these "plants" are somewhat tasty all alone, though the surprising taste of the Clossom makes it closer to raw meat in gameplay standards.
