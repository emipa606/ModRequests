====================
  NAME XML DETAILS
====================

The NameDefs file allows you to add names to the game's database. A typical entry in your NameDefs file might look something like this:

	<REB_Code.NameDef>
		<defName>Name001</defName>
		<name><first>Rayne</first><nick>Rainbeau</nick><last>Flambe</last></name>
		<gender>Male</gender>
		<childhoodStory>RayneC01</childhoodStory>
		<adulthoodStory>RayneA01</adulthoodStory>
	</REB_Code.NameDef>

-- <defName> --

The first tag, <defName>, is a unique identifier for the name in question. It should contain only alphanumeric characters (no spaces), and should be different from the defNames that you've assigned to any other names.

-- <name> --

The <name> tag contains three subtags, <first>, <nick> and <last>. If an entry includes both a first and a last name, with or without a nickname, it will be added to the game's "full names" database and only to that database. (So if you add "Horatio Hornblower," for example, you might meet Horatio Hornblower, but you won't meet a Horatio Smith or a Joseph Hornblower.) If an entry contains only one of the three names, though, it will be added to the appropriate shuffleable database. (So if you just add the first name "Horatio," you might meet a bunch or Horatios with various surnames, and if you add just the surname "Hornblower," you might meet a Dave or a Sally Hornblower.)

-- <gender> --

The use of the <gender> tag should be self-evident. Valid values are: <gender>Male</gender>, <gender>Female</gender>, and <gender>Either</gender>. If a name entry doesn't include a gender, it will default to being usable by pawns of either gender.

-- <childhoodStory> and <adulthoodStory> --

The <childhoodStory> and <adulthoodStory> tags are optional. If you use them, though, they must both be used, and they can only be used in conjunction with full names. If a name entry, as in the example above, includes those tags, then that name will be "locked" such that it always and only appears with the defined childhood and adulthood stories.

===================
  NAME LIST FILES
===================

These files are found in the "Name Lists" folder instead of in the "Defs" folder.

There really isn't much that needs to be said about them. The name list files are simple text lists of all the names you want included in a particular category, and what those categories are should be pretty clear from the files' names. Note, though, that unlike the XML files, which can be given whatever names you prefer, the files in the "Name Lists" folder *must* keep the names I gave them, or the game won't read them.

One thing that might not be immediately self-evident is the use of the Sets_Female.txt and Sets_Male.txt files, but they're actually pretty straightforward, too. In the real world, many people have nicknames that are shortened forms of or otherwise derived from their given names. The "Sets" files are lists of pairings of first names and nicknames, which allow pawns in your games to have such nicknames, as well.

Finally, in the "FilterSet Name Lists" subfolder, you'll find a special set of names lists files. These allow you to define special sets of names to be used in conjunction with FilterSet backstory sets you've created. For example, in the provided database, medieval backstories are all flagged with the "FilterSet1" tag, so that medieval childhoods and medieval adulthoods are always and only attached to each other. Additionally, a special set of names has been included in the FilterSet1_First_Female.txt, FilterSet1_First_Male.txt, and FilterSet1_Last.txt files. These names, drawn from medieval English names, will be used for pawns with medieval backstories, instead of names drawn from the larger primary database.
