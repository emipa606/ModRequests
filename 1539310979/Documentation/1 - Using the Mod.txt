===========================================================
  WELCOME TO "RAINBEAU'S EDITABLE BACKSTORIES AND NAMES"!
===========================================================


A note for those updating from previous versions.... If you already have some custom XML backstory files, you'll probably need to do some global search-and-replace editing. In alpha-17, the "Scary" work tag was removed, and the skill "Research" was renamed "Intellectual." In beta-18, XML tags were made case-sensitive, so that tags which aren't the correct case (e.g., <Slot> instead of <slot>) will generate error messages. In beta-19, the skill "Growing" was renamed "Plants," and the system used for referencing pawn names and pronouns in backstories was altered, with, for example, "[PAWN_nameDef]" replacing "NAME." Additionally, a few traits were added to and a few were removed from the game, so forced and/or disallowed traits lists might need to be updated.


(1) THE PROVIDED FILES:

Files of interest as you begin editing the mod's databases can be found in three separate folders. The "Defs" folder is the folder from which the game actually reads data. It contains the XML files from which backstories and some names will be read into the game. The "Name Lists" folder contains the text files from which most names will be read. Finally, the "Example XML Files" folder contains a collection of mostly-unedited backstories from the vanilla game and several other sources, that you can use as a starting point in creating your own customized set.

Within the "Defs" folder, you'll find a total of 10 backstory XML files. These comprise the set of well-edited backstories I've put together for "out of the box" usage with the mod. Included are most of the basic and tribal backstories from the vanilla game, many of the "snowflake" backstories, and a few of the "Pirate King" backstories, as well as tribal backstories created by RimRue, a few from the old "Storybook" mod collection, and several original entries. Details regarding the skill bonuses, traits, etc., assigned to pawns by these backstories can be found in the "Backstory Reference Data" Excel file included in the mod's "Documentation" folder. You'll also find a "NameDefs" XML file, containing a few name entries, most of them attached to specific backstories.

Note that you can add or delete files from the "Defs" folder as you see fit. There are no rules regarding file names, and it makes no difference how you split up backstories amongst your various files.

In the "Name Lists" folder, you'll find 10 text files containing the various lists from which the mod draws to create pawn names.

In the "Example XML Files" folder, there are a total of 15 XML backstory files. First, there are two each (one containing childhood and the other adulthood backstories) for each the following four sets from the vanilla game:

+ Tribal: These, of course, are the backstories for tribal characters.

+ Basic: These are the generic non-tribal backstories, running the gamut from medieval serfs to glitterworld layabouts.

+ Snowflake: The "snowflake" backgrounds are the ones created by lower-tier Kickstarter backers. You'll probably want to look through this file, and edit or delete specific entries as you see fit. Most should work "as is," but some are (in my opinion, anyway) a bit inconsistent with the game's style, and/or just don't work very well as half of a scrambled backstory.

+ PirateKing: These are the backstories created by upper-tier Kickstarter backers. I strongly advise against using the PirateKing XML files without careful editing, as a fair number of these backstories are overpowered, and many of them would make absolutely no sense as half of a randomly-generated pawn background.

(Note that all of the above files are based on the backstory database as it existed in the alpha-16 version of RimWorld. Some new backstories were added, and others may have been edited, in more recent versions of the game, but I haven't bothered to update the example files.)

The backstory files in the "Example XML Files" folder have been only minimally edited by me. Hardcoded gender pronouns and pawn names have been removed, and typos that I happened to notice have been corrected, but otherwise, they remain pretty much as they appear in the vanilla game.

One change I did make is that most backstories are now universally available. What I mean by that is that most non-tribal backstories are defined to be available to pawns of any spawn category (civil, raider, slave, traveler or trader). The one exception is that, for obvious reasons, backstories which disable violence won't show up on raiders, and neither will backstories which specify how kind and/or law-abiding a character is.

Also located in the "Example XML Files" folder are files (again, one containing childhood and the other adulthood backstories) from Krush's "Storyteller" mod. I take no credit for the backstories in these files; they are not mine. They were written by Andouce, CommunityCoreLibrary, Drako Edor, Igabod, Krush, mokonasakura, and Ray_Anor. But "Storyteller" hasn't been updated since RimWorld alpha-14, so I figured its backstories were probably worth bringing back out into the light. 

Finally, there are three files containing a few backstories created by Ludeon forum user AngleWyrm, and two files containing tribal backstories created by Ludeon forum user RimRue, specifically for use with "Editable Backstories."


(2) EDITING:

You can, of course, alter anything you like in the mod's XML files or name lists. That is, after all, the whole point of the mod. Be careful not to mess up the XML formatting, obviously, but otherwise, you can change pretty much anything you like.

If you're not familiar with editing XML files, the most important thing to understand is that they are simply text files, and so can be opened and modified with any text editor. My recommendation is to use Notepad++. It's free to download, it's more robust than the basic version of Notepad that comes packaged with Windows, and it includes features specifically designed to be useful when editing XML or program code.

Details regarding the structure, tags, and acceptable content of the BackstoryDefs and NameDefs files can be found in the "BackstoryDef XML Details" and "NameDef XML Details" documentation files.

As was already noted above, there are no "rules" regarding how you organize your XML files. The default files are arranged with childhood and adulthood backstories in separate files only because that's an arrangement that makes sense to me. If you prefer to have all of your backstories in a single large file, you can do so. If you want to have separate files for different categories of stories, you can do that. If you wanted to have a separate file for each individual backstory, you could even do that, though it'd be pretty silly.

When you start the game, if there are errors in any of your XML files, you'll usually see errors in your log file helping you to pinpoint exactly what you did wrong. You'll also see in the log file a tally of the number of backstories and names added, so you can tell if some of your data is missing from the game for any reason. (One likely reason for missing data is that you've assigned multiple backstories the same defName. That, unfortunately, is a mistake that the game won't catch, and which won't show up specifically as an error in your log file.) 


(3) EDITING "HUMANOID ALIEN RACES" BACKSTORIES:

HAR alien race backstory XML files can be edited just as can REB backstory files. They do not have to be moved from their base mod's folder, and in fact should be left there.  Note, however, that the new filter options added in REB will not be available for HAR backstory files, as alien backstory assignment is handled by HAR, not by REB, and HAR isn't coded to recognize the new filters.


(4) AVOIDING STEAM WORKSHOP OVERWRITES:

If you download this mod from the Steam workshop and then just directly edit the XML files in the "Defs" folder, those files will get overwritten when Steam downloads an updated version of the mod to your computer. Obviously, you don't want that to happen. So you'll need to use a "static" version of the mod.

You actually have two folders on your computer containing mods for RimWorld.

The first (by default on Windows) is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\

The second (also by default on Windows) is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\294100\

The first folder, at the very least, contains a folder named "Core." The second contains folders (identified by numbers) for all the RimWorld mods to which you've subscribed on Steam.

Copy this mod's folder (which will be identified by its Steam ID number) from the second mods folder into the first. You can rename the copied version of the folder as you see fit. Edit the XML files in that copied folder; they won't be affected by Steam downloads of mod updates.

The next time you load RimWorld, you'll see that you have two entries for "Editable Backstories" in your mods list. Make sure that you're using the one with the folder icon, and not the one with the Steam icon.
