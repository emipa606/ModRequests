  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Editable Backstories and Names"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!

- 10/12/2018
	- Added the ability to define special lists of names to be used together with
	  backstory FilterSets. (For example, in the provided database, pawns with
	  medieval backstories will now have names drawn from a list of medieval
	  English names, rather than from the main name database.)
	- Altered the optional backstory "source" tags to use parentheses instead of
	  brackets, so the game doesn't misread them.
	- Squashed a bug that occasionally caused null exception errors when the game
	  tried to create a new pawn.

- 10/07/2018
	- Updated mod name from "Editable Backstories" to "Editable Backstories and
	  Names."
	- Fixed body type randomization, which was inadvertently broken in the
	  initial update to b19.
	- Added 17 backstories to the mod's database, based on vanilla Pirate King
	  and "snowflake" backstories added to the game since a16.
	- The mod now supports adding names to the game's database from simple text
	  files, in addition to adding them from an XML names file. The latter is
	  primarily useful now for defining name/backstory sets, rather than for
	  simple name lists.
	- Added the ability to define lists of "sets" of first names and nicknames,
	  so pawns can have nicknames that actually have a connection to their given
	  names.
	- Normal mode no longer literally overwrites the vanilla database. Vanilla
	  backstories will still be visible in (and can be selected from) "Prepare 
	  Carefully" or similar mods, but will never be given to pawns randomly.
	- Switching between "lite" and normal modes no longer requires restarting the
	  game.
	- A new configuration option allows you to add a source tag to backstory
	  titles, so you can easily tell them apart in "Prepare Carefully." This tag
	  will also be visible in pawns' bio windows, but can easily be removed just
	  by resetting the config option.
	- Random backstory selection now has a slight bias against backstories which
	  disable dumb labor, firefighting or violence. (This change was inspired by
	  the "weighting" of backstories that was added to vanilla in b19.)
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 09/12/2018 (UPDATE BY KIAME VIVACITY)
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release. Note that the skill "Growing" is now
	  called "Plants" instead. Any custom backstories will need to be updated 
	  accordingly. Similarly, "NAME," "HE," "HIM" and "HIS" usage in backstory 
	  baseDesc text needs to be updated to "[PAWN_nameDef]," "[PAWN_pronoun],"
	  "[PAWN_objective]" and "[PAWN_possessive]," respectively. (There is no
	  longer, however, any need to specify capitalization.) 
	- Updated the version of the Harmony library the mod uses.

- 01/07/2018
	- Cleaned up a few minor "behind the scenes" things.

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 12/03/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- The formerly-separate "lite" version of the mod has been replaced with a
	  configuration option. You can now easily switch between the default and the
	  lite version, depending upon whether you want to replace or merely add to
	  the vanilla backstory database.

- 09/18/2017
	- Removed the adjustment to the Pyromaniac trait's commonality. That never
	  really belonged in this mod, anyway, and has been moved to my "Consolidated
	  Traits" mod.
	- Made a few minor adjustments to prep compatibility with my (still in
	  development, but hopefully soon to be released) "Editable Pawn Names" mod.

- 06/21/2017
	- The mod now checks to see if "Pawns Are Capable!" is in use, and if it is,
	  adjusts backstories to replace incapabilities with the appropriate new 
	  traits.
	- If "Pawns Are Capable!" is in use, its new traits will be used alongside
	  work type requirements and skill bonuses/penalties to prevent incompatible
	  backstories from being randomly paired.
	- (Slightly edited versions of) RimRue's tribal backstories are now part of
	  the default backstory set.
	- Did some more minor editing/adjusting of the default backstories, including
	  adding age-based filters to a few of the "this pawn is old and experienced"
	  adult backstories.

- 06/08/2017
	- Added the ability to filter backstories based on a pawn's age.
	- All vanilla names are now available to appear in games, as was originally
	  intended. (Previously, some were inadvertently being excluded.)
	- The "Options" menu ability to define preferred names that should be used in
	  games now recognizes player-defined names.

- 06/04/2017
	- Added "[RF]" prefix tag to the mod's name for easier mod list sorting.

- 05/08/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld alpha 17. Note that the WorkTag "Scary" no longer
	  exists, and that the skill "Research" is now called "Intellectual" instead.
	  Any custom backstories will need to be updated accordingly.
	- Added RimRue's tribal backstory sets to the distribution.

- 04/23/2017
	- The mod now uses the Harmony library instead of detouring core methods.
	- As a side effect of the above change, the mod is now fully compatible with
	  HAF, without the need for a separate version.

- 04/15/2017
	- Body type definitions in childhood backstories are no longer ignored.
	- Pawn body type is again randomized when no body type is defined for the
	  pawn's backstory.
	- Corrected a few pronoun typos in default backstory files.
	- Tweaked the log file messages.
	- Split HAF compatibility into a separate mod.

- 04/03/2017
	- Pawn body types, if not defined in backstories, will now simply default to
	  "male" or "female," rather than being randomized. (Vanilla behavior has
	  been restored.)

- 04/02/2017
	- Added the ability to define the relative rarity of backstories.
	- Added the ability to filter backstories by pawn gender.
	- Added the ability to define "sets" of backstories, such that stories which
	  belong to a particular set will always and only be attached to other
	  stories in the same set.
	- Childhood and adulthood backstories will no longer be combined if one
	  "favors" and the other "disfavors" a particular skill.
	- Fat and Hulk body types now have a (small) chance to show up randomly, just
	  as the Thin body type already did. 
	- Added a TraitDefs file with a revised def for the Pyromaniac trait, making 
	  it much less common.
	- Any errors in backstory or name definitions files caught by the code will
	  now generate messages in the log file. (Previously, a few were silently
	  ignored.)
	- The log file also now prints a tally of the number of backstories and names
	  added, so even if errors in the XML aren't caught by the code, you'll be
	  able to tell if something's missing.
	- The mod is now compatible with "Humanoid Alien Framework," albeit through
	  an inelegant kludge. I'll try to clean things up in the next release.
	- Expanded and improved the default backstory set.
	- Greatly expanded the detail in the mod's documentation.

- 03/12/2017
	- It's now possible to create "linked" backstories (sets consisting of a
	  name, a childhood and an adulthood which always appear together).
	- The mod is now more usable "out of the box," as I've moved most of the XML
	  files to a side folder to prevent the "badly in need of editing"
	  backstories from loading in the game.
	- I've done further editing and cleanup on the XML files which do still load,
	  to make sure that they provide a good base set of backstories.

- 03/09/2017
	- Initial release.
