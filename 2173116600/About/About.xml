	<description>Version: 1.0.0.0 For v1.1+

Type A:
Changes max connections to 25 for Multi Analyzer, Vitals Monitor and Tool Cabinet.
Also makes it so Vitals Monitor does not need to be adjacent to a bed, meaning it can now be the only one in the room.

Using the patch system, ensures maximum compatibility with any other mods.

Load Order: Last - Just in case. (or first...)

Compatibility: 'should' not conflict with a darn thing... it's a patch mod.
By loading it last, it ensures full compatibility.

Credits: Ogliss, from Rimworld Discord, gave me a helping hand to understand the patch system better - Thank you!
Without him, this and the Tribal Headwear for Civilized worlds would not work.
