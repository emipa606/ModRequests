Adds ceiling-, floor- and wall-mounted lights, plus electrical torch and brazier.

----------



Changelog:

[u]Updated for 1.4[/b]

- Changed all lights to work with the vanilla color picker

- Removed electrical darklights (the electrical torch and dark torch remain the same)


[u]Updated for 1.3[/u]

- All lights now require Electricity research

- Added colored versions of all three lights in red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta - requires Colored Lights research

- Added darklight versions of all three (Ideology only)

- All wall, ceiling, and path lights can overlay other furniture and/or zones

- Added electric brazier (Royalty only; requires no fuel, can be built from any metal, satisfies need for throne room, can be used for meditation)

- Added electric torch (requires no fuel, but gives out no heat, and can be used for meditation focus)

- Added electric darktorch (same as regular electric torch, Ideology only)


I haven't gotten into C+, so I wasn't able to make it so the flames die when the torches and braziers are turned off, but I hope to get that figured out eventually.

Thanks to the other modders on the RimWorld discord for helping me get this all updated!
