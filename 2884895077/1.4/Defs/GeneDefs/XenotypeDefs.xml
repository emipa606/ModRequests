    <description>Scorchlanders are a subrace of humanity with dark ashen skin and glowing eyes who mysteriously became part of the galactic community after emerging from a long uncontacted rimworld's moon. They are natural born desert survivors and can withstand hot temperatures, plus metabolize raw food without any ill effects. While they are renowned for their crafting ability, they struggle with tasks ill-fitting of a desert nomad like cooking, farming, and especially mining.</description>
