Rebalances and modifies stuff from the  ETRT: Tribal Apparel mod to vanilla-like levels using Xpath patches.
Author: Vats Darkagma

- Early release: a few things still need to be tweaked like the actual costs and hassle to make hoods and helms with awesome mystical powers. Descriptions need to be improved too.

- Quick summary:
- Production of hoods and helms require sacrificed animals offered at a campfire to be transmuted into mystical apparel.
- Neolithic clothes nerfed to vanilla-like levels. Usually balanced by trading protection for insulation and vice-versa.

* Requirements:

- Requires ETRT: Tribal Apparel mod by Evil Tactician ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544558250 ).

* ANY HARD COMPATABILITIES??

Could conflict with ZARS Tribal Reborn because that mod is a mess.
