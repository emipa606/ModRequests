  <description>Trainable breeding insects.
  
  This mod makes insects a little less wild, trainable, able to breed and lay eggs, sometimes show up in biomes they arent normally in, and arrive in herds.
  
  Spelopede - Can lay a fertilized egg every 8 days which hatches in 8 days. Trainbility advanced, pack animal and texture, and large enough to rescue and haul.
  
  MegaScarab - Can lay a fertilized egg every 6 days which hatches in 6 days. Trainability advanced but not big enough to rescue.
  
  MegaSpider - Can lay a fertilized egg every 10 days which hatches in 10 days. Trainbility intermediate, pack animal and texture. Milk 9 insect Jelly every 2 days.
  
  Compatibility - Uses xpath patching for changes so should be completely.
  
  Safe to add and remove? Safe to add yes, safe to remove though you'll get errors on the first load and loose eggs etc...
