Ever wished that the male and female supremacist memes had more options and more impact on gameplay? This mod adds extra precepts and options to make pawn gender meaningful and closely tied to their ideology.

Features
  - Gender specific precept sets for each skill.
  - Disapproved work is learnt at 50% the rate of approved.
  - Mood and opinion penalties for wielding disapproved weapons.
  - Settings to make many stats gender specific (now supports ungendered).
  - Affects all humanlike pawns (not currently race specific).

Patches
  - Pawn generation (to add gender specific hediffs).
  - Skill record learning rates (to alter specific learn rates).
  - Skill UI skill descriptions

Compatibility
  - Should be compatible with almost anything.

Inspired by "Sex Matters" by CitizenKanye but with more flexibility for you to craft your own story.
