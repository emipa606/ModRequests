  <description>RimTrust: A legacy mod to enchance endgame and become a true superpower with abundant riches!
  
  Original code from RimBank by user19990313 and 1.1 version of Bar0th included.
  See workshop page for documentation:
  
  Warning:
   -use at own risk (should be save file compatible; see original info by user19990313)

   This is an updated fork of RimBank (Continued) with additional content. I claim no ownership of the original mod. This mod may be taken down by request from the original author.
