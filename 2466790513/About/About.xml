	<description>Are you tired of seeing rotten corpses all around your map? Are your colonists starving to death because of an ill-timed blight on an ice sheet? Are you looking to feed your prisoners something other than the flesh of their dead comrades?

Look no further, for this mod is for you. If you're desperate enough to eat rotten meat, that is.

	FEATURES

Rotten (but not desiccated) corpses can now be butchered at a butchering spot or butchering table to obtain rotten meat. The amount of rotten meat yielded depends on the body size of the creature.

Meat that has been left in temperatures above the freezing point for too long will also turn into rotten meat rather than simply disappearing. Unlike regular meat, rotten meat will not rot (but it will deteriorate like other items if left unroofed and outside), so it can be stored indefinitely in a closed, roofed room.

However, keep in mind that rotten meat isn't very nutritious, and it also has a 90% chance of causing food poisoning to humans, making it unsuitable for most situations. It is possible to cook rotten meat into a rotten meal at a campfire or stove. This reduces its food poisoning chance to 55%, but wastes a lot of the ingredients.

All in all, rotten meat is a viable (but dangerous) last-resort option for starving colonies. Use at your own risk.

	FAQ

1. Is there a difference between rotten meat that came from an animal and rotten meat that came from a human/insect/other animal?
A. No. They are all treated the same, have the same stats, and will give the same mood debuffs when eaten.

2. Is it compatible with:
	- Butcher Rotten Corpse?
	A. Yes.

	- Any other mod that adds rotten meat, the ability to butcher rotten corpses, etc?
	A. As long as the other mod doesn't use the same defName as this mod for its items and recipes, it should be fine.

3. Is it safe to add to an ongoing save?
A. Yes, absolutely. However, it is good practice to make a backup of the save file before adding it, just in case something unexpectedly goes wrong.

4. Is it safe to remove from ongoing saves?
A. Yes, absolutely. Just remove all instances of rotten meat and delete the "butcher rotten corpse" bills from workbenches before removing the mod. Also, be sure to make a backup of the save file, just in case something unexpectedly goes wrong.
