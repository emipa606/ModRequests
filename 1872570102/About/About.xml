A selection of thematic music, added to your RimWorld playlist.  The selection could be categorized as down-tempo/chill-out/ambient-electronica/folk. I will continue to add more songs to this mod as they're discovered.  If anyone has any artists (with songs available under Creative Commons) to suggest, please let me know!
