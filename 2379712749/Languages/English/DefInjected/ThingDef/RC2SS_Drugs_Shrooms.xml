  <RC2_Shrooms.description>These 'magic' mushrooms, found only in the wild, cause the user to hallucinate and go on a 'trip' through what is often seen as a weird, strange reality. Not all of those who make it back are the same. Shrooms are a relatively safe drug - but users build up a tolerance for them very quickly.  Long-term users see an increased amount and severity of mental breaks the longer they use the drug - however, any sort of brain damage is extremely rare, and only if the user has a high level of the drug in their body for long periods of time.</RC2_Shrooms.description>
