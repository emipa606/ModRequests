  <RC2_Dreamstick.description>A carefully refined zopioid known for its medical uses, dreamsticks, as they are known on the Rim, are a combat pain reliever prized by soldiers and doctors alike.  By using a specially designed, one-use auto-injector, the drug can be safely and quickly injected to relieve pain quickly and relatively safely.  Useful for keeping a soldier in combat longer or helping get one to safety.  Be warned however, once it wears off the pain comes back stronger for a short time.</RC2_Dreamstick.description>
