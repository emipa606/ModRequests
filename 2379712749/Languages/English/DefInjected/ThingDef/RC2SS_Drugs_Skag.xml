  <RC2_Skag.description>A refined and condensed Zopioid based on Zope.  This stuff is far more powerful and will knock anyone who injects it out for a few hours with a euphoric high.  Overdosing is quite easy on this stuff and there are a number of sideffects; however, many of those addicted tend to not care as they chase that high which becomes more and more difficult to obtain.</RC2_Skag.description>
