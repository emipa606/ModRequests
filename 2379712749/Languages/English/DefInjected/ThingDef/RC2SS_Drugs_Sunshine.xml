  <RC2_Sunshine.description>Sunshine is a potent hallucinogenic drug made from refined and condensed shrooms and neutroamine. Relatively non-addictive, it is a potent mood booster, but makes the user useless when performing tasks.  While not very addictive, long-term users have been noted to suffer from a drug-induced form of dementia, so use sparingly.</RC2_Sunshine.description>
