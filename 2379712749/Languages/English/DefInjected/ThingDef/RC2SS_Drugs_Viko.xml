  <RC2_Viko.description>Combining zope and healroot into a paste then drying it into a powder and pressing it into little pellets or tablets, Viko is a mild pain relief medicine commonly found on the Rim.  Although mildly addictive, it is relatively safe to use if done so carefully.  Great for chronic pain.  Often put into drinks to make 'purple drank'.</RC2_Viko.description>
