# No Edge Fade - Lite
A RimWorld mod:

Man-made tiles no longer fade out when bordering other terrain types -
instead, they will have distinct, crisp edges.  Borders between two
natural terrains will still be faded.

If you want ALL terrain borders (except natural shorelines) to be crisp,
check out the original No Edge Fade mod.

### Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld **v1.0**, **v1.1**, **v1.2**, and the **Royalty** DLC.
- Might be compatible with **v1.3** and the **Ideology** DLC, but I haven't
  tested it much
- This mod hasn't been updated in a while, so there are probably bugs
- If you find any bugs, please let me know and I'll try to keep up
- There probably aren't any game-breaking incompatibilities, **BUT...**

This mod drastically re-orders the rendering precedence of terrains.
Floors and terrains added by other mods will probably not match this new
order.  Worst case scenario, their terrain borders might fade when they
shouldn't, or vice versa.

Good news, though: This mod can be easily updated to fix these issues.
Please feel free to make a compatibility request for any mods you like.
