Notes On Integrating With Combat Extended features

NightVision (NV) affects combat in vanilla Rimworld (RW) as does Combat Extended(CE).

This doc outlines ways NV can add to the features found in Combat Extended
whilst preseving the spirit of both.

Currently NV affects Ranged Accuracy, Ranged Cooldown, Melee accuracy, Melee dodge chance,
and adds a surprise attack chance

The following is a break down of the possible targets for patching in CE's code:

1. Ranged Accuracy

CE uses a lighting shift modifier which is inversely and linearly proportional to glow 
at the targets position.

Verb_LaunchProjectileCE.ShiftVecReportFor(LocalTargetInfo target){
	...
	            report.lightingShift = 1 - caster.Map.glowGrid.GameGlowAt(targetCell);
	...
}

Patch: Postfix
Maths:
	let x = report.lightingShift = 1 - glow
	let m = shooter's NV light multiplier

	let g(m, x) = light modifier function
	let k(x) = composition factor

	then f(x) = xk(x) + (1-k(x))g(x)
			  = modified lighting shift result

	where x < 0.5 ( => glow > 0.5):
		m = shooter's full light multiplier
		g(m, x) = mx - m + 1
		k(x) = 1.5 - x
		1- k(x) = -0.5 + x


	where x > 0.5 ( => glow < 0.5):
		m = shooter's zero light multiplier
		l(x) = (1.8 - M)x
		k(x) = 0.5 + x
		1-k(x) = 0.5 - x

2. Ranged Cooldown

Rather than affecting this, better to alter reload speed.
Reload speed does not have a custom c# stat worker
can either patch the c# consumer or the xml

3. Melee dodge chance and accuracy
