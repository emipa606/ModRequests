# Hyperweave Plantation mod

This mod has been borrowed from [**Foxy Dog**](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056914692) after he declined to support it.     
I am planning to support this mod from now own.

## Original description
(copied from the steam mod page, only minor tweaks applied)

Due to hyperweave being almost impossible to obtain in vanilla game, I have created a mod for this particular problem.    
Now your colonists will be able to wear top condition leather against raiders! Flower is also beautiful to look at.

You can grow these bad boys in the mid-late game after unlocking "MEDICINE PRODUCTION" as prerequisite.

+ Sensitive to ground fertility :
- 25 grow days (equivalent to 47 real grow days due to resting period) to flourish on regular soil but only takes approx 12 real grow days with hydroponics

+ Each flower yields 7 hyperweave cloth

+ Colonists require 12 planting skill to grow

Safe to add and remove from existing savefile.    
Dependencies: None

The mod works with tilted soil and is COMPATIBLE with 130 mods I have so far.
