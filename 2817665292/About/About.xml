	<description>Tired of the old standing lamp? Want more choice, more style?
Add four new standing lamps and a set of string lights (they go anywhere!) to light up your beautiful colony.
'Electricity' research is the prerequisite and the lamps are found in the furniture tab. Cost and power consumption are similar to the basic standing lamp.</description>
