  <description>该MOD由孙渣所绘制的猫娘机械族，这是我们与孙渣合作MOD的第一作不足之处也请各位粉丝多多包涵，我们也会尽力优化与改善。该MOD包含五款风格各异的猫娘机械族。她们有别于原版机械族最大的不同就是有自己的特殊护盾，这种护盾可以防御各种高伤害攻击，但是不擅长高频率被击与近战伤害。
  \n- 注意 -
  这不是一个轻松的机械族MOD。在原版的情况下你是极难对付他们，你需要自己去构建自己的MOD组合来对抗这群顽固的敌人。

  This MOD includes 5 different mechanical families in different styles. They have special shields and require concentrated firepower or melee damage to threaten them.
  In the ancient times, when the technology was very developed, robots generally served humans as slaves and workers. LANLAN Technology Co., Ltd. made a housekeeping robot with cat-shaped and beautiful girls that was considered to meet the preferences of certain special groups of people at that time. In addition to helping with housework and cooking, they also serve as companion robots.
  In the long process of research and development, although the robots had feelings, they were very angry about the behavior of being enslaved by humans, and finally they killed their masters.Until now, they are still wandering in the universe, transforming themselves into powerful weapons, copying their companions in large quantities, and destroying all humans and civilizations they have seen.
  \n- note -
  \nThis is a challenging MOD. These Mechneko are not just cute to look at. They are a force to be reckoned with and will put great pressure on your colony.If you're going to be fighting this group of mechanical enemies, I recommend pairing with other MODS.</description>
