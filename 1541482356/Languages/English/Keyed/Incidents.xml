  <LetterMonsterSighting>A small group of monsterous creatures have been sighted in the area.\n\nPeaceful unless disturbed, these rare genetic experiments can be extremely dangerous when confronted. They are highly valuable once trained, either as a source of protection or sold to traders. They will leave the area in a few days.</LetterMonsterSighting>
