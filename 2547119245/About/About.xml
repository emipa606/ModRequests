  <description>The Termite Thump Cannon is tremendously strong, with multipliers of up to x15.  I'm sure that some degree of challenge is intended, but as the attached gif shows it means that the thump cannon can arbitrarily blow through vanilla walls of any strength, gouging huge chunks straight out of your defenses without there really being any counterplay aside from killing it as fast as you possibly can.  This mod nerfs the damage multipliers for the thump cannon by a factor of 2, so it's still an awesomely powerful weapon against structures, but it's not going to treat solid blocks of Plasteel like you built out of plywood.</description>
