	<description>Wrist mounted rocket launcher, what more could you ask for?
	
	I loved the idea of Vanilla Grenades Expanded but never really found the grenade belts all that useful because I could just use Simple Sidearms and carry around an infinite number of whatever grenade I felt like using and save my utility slots for more interesting items like the Rim-Effect ammunition modifications. All that being said, I felt that the grenade belts were expensive and fairly limited in their operation due to the short range so this mod adds Mandolorian style wrist launchers that can fire grenades at a longer range, that's it.
	
	I plan to expand on the mod at a later date like adding more custom textures, maybe custom sounds, adding new types of launchers like firefoam, toxin, flashbangs, etc and possibly extra abilities like a flamethrower for all launchers just to make it feel even more Mando style. If you have an suggestion for what to add or even a completely different mod then feel free to make suggestions, this is my first mod so I have a lot learn but I'll try my best.
