	<description>Proof-of-concept mod I made for fun, using the fact that attacking faction bases are not mandatory content of the game.

	I was always disappointed at how easy it is to destroy NPC faction bases, since enemy does not properly scale to player's strength unlike raids. Since I did not have sufficient modding knowledge to change this, I instead increased strength of enemies that defend vanilla NPC bases.

	These sprawling bases are defended by numerous units stronger than the original, posing an optional end-game challenge that will take herculean efforts to overcome. Attacking these bases will be suicidal, because they are intended to be near impossible to beat - but perhaps some ambitious player could aim to destroy them, purely just for the satisfaction of taking down the behemoth...
