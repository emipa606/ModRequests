<size=18><color=#3986B3>[Description]</color></size>
This mod simply allows pawns to shoot anything in an adjacent tile. It removes the "(too close)" message when right-clicking an enemy.

You can configure every gun (including modded) to abide by this rule or be exempt from it in the mod settings. Requires HugsLib! Special thanks to "roolo" on Steam for letting me use his code from RunAndGun!

<size=18><color=#3986B3>[Compatibility]</color></size>
This should work with basically everything. I don't see how it could ever be incompatible with something else but do let me know if it is!
It's 1000% safe to add and remove from existing saves. 
Terms and Conditions apply - I'm not liable for death, torture, slavery or imprisonment as a result of you manically running in with a crowbar and being gunned down.
