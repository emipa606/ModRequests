	<XenotypeXenogermDescription>A self-contained biological organ containing one or more implantable xenogenes.\n\nOnce implanted inside a host's body, the xenogerm modifies the host's genes, gene expression, and phenotypic development using viruses, hormones, bio-synthesized drugs, and possibly mechanites. The host will develop a wide variety of exotic traits and abilities, transforming them into a {0}.\n\nXenogerm implantation is a traumatic process. Once implanted with a xenogerm, a person will be bedridden for days as the transformation sets in.\n\nDuring storage and transport, xenogerms are kept safe in sealed containers.</XenotypeXenogermDescription>
