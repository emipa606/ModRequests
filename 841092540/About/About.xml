 This simple mod uses PatchOperations, maximizing compatibility with other mods. I recommend placing this mod at/near the bottom of your load order, but nothing bad will happen if you don't.
 This mod is save-safe and can be added/removed to new or existing games as you please.
 Don't worry if I forget to update this mod and it's listed as out-of-date. This mod is very simple, if I died yesterday this mod will most likely still work far into the future.

Supports Rimworld Versions 1.0 to 1.4+
