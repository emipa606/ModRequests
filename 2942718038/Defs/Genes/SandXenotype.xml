    <description>A hardy people adapted to arid climates, the Sandpeople were an early foray into creating a heat resistant people. Unfortunately, a mistake led to Sandpeople's having several areas in their brain shrunk, leading to an unfortunate affinity to paranoia and superstition. These desert dwellers do not necessarily share the exact same superstitions from tribe to tribe, but certain superstitions seem to be universally persistent. These include:

-Covering their entire body in cloth to avoid the gaze of wrathful desert spirits

-Speaking in gurgles due to fear of those same desert spirits listening to their words and becoming enraged

-Xenophobia

They should not be underestimated, however. Sandpeople are fierce warriors, and they are more than capable of swarming and overwhelming any faction that draws their ire.</description>
    <descriptionShort>Sand People as they are sometimes known, wear abundant clothing to protect themselves from extreme heat.</descriptionShort>
