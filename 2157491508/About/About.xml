    <description>Project RimFactory automated versions of the Science Never Stops workbenches. Based on the PRF Metal Refinery.
    
    Since I'm not a fan of the whole "Hunt down components you can't make, even though you have godlike knowledge and manufacturing power" thing, I have also added recipes to make the exotic components to the Atomic Fabricator, for 1000 Cosmic Matter each. I did not tamper with their tradeability at all, so if you prefer to hunt them down, you can.
    
    This mod is also compatible with the reskin, SNS:YGTF. To add this compatibility, I had to remove the hard dependency on SNS:AOTC, but one or the other SNS is necessary.</description>
