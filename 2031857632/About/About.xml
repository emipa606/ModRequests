"The Barrows brothers were a band of six legendary Saradominist warriors
who ventured into Morytania during the God Wars, leading the Morytania Campaign.
Their fate is revealed in the crumbling tome. They struck a deal with a mysterious stranger
for power, and after their deaths, the Stranger came to 'collect' them, and they were buried in
six burial mounds, or Barrows, in eastern Morytania, giving them their collective name."
