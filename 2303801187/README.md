# Quiver: More Bows

A RimWorld mod that adds several new and interesting bows throughout the tech tree.



## The Bows

### Greatbow of Compassion
A variant of the greatbow that fires a blunt projectile, which has a tendency to disable rather than maim or kill. Unlocked with Greatbow research.

### Greatbow of Rage
A variant of the greatbow that fires an arrow which ignites the target on hit. The arrow must connect with an object (pawn, tree, animal, bush, etc) in order to start a fire, making it RELATIVELY safe compared to incendiary weapons. Unlocked with Greatbow research.

### Advanced Recurve Bow
New item. A space-age take on the recurve bow which is very accurate and powerful but has a long warmup time, somewhat akin to the bolt action rifle. Unlocked with Recurve bow and Machining research.

### Gravity Bow
New item. A sci-fi inspired weapon that fires a shock wave. The pulse does very little damage, but has a strong knockback effect and a moderate chance to disable the target. Unlocked with Greatbow and Fabrication research.

### Proton Bow
New item. A sci-fi inspired weapon that fires a beam of energy. The proton bow has a very long warmup time, high damage, and exceptional accuracy, but the beam moves very slowly. It also has a strong chance to apply carcinoma on hit. Available via trade only.

### Electron Bow
New item. A sci-fi inspired weapon that fires a burst of energy. The electron bow does very little damage and is inherently inaccurate, but can be fired very quickly. Also has a small chance to shock the target. Available via trade only.



## FAQ

It SHOULD, but honestly, I'm not sure. This is my first RimWorld mod. If you have trouble, please leave a helpful comment and I'll see what I can do.
