	<description>Arylice's Automatic Hunting
#arylice #aryah

Tired of manually marking prey to hunt?
Have it automatic for free!
You look away for 5 minutes and notice that
your hunters are starving while there are plenty
of living prey around them?
No longer will it be a problem!

Automatic Hunting automatically marks potential animals
to hunt and will give your hunters the job to hunt
if there aren't enough meat in storage!

Here's how the automation works in any map:
* Hunters must have a Work Priority to Hunt of any number.
* Hunters must not be Drafted nor Downed.
* Prey will be automatically marked to be hunted only
if the hunters can reach them.
* Prey must not have Scaria nor any Mental State.
* There needs to be less than [?]
amount of allowed meat in storage.
* The amount of allowed edible corpses on the ground needs
to be less than twice the amount of Colonists in the map.
* Once every [?] amount of hours, if possible,
animals will be marked as targets for hunters.
* Every twice that [?] amount of hours, if possible, hunters will be
given the job to hunt and attack. This includes bare fist hunters.
* Pressing H (Misc2) + N (Misc4) = 
Disable / Enable Automatic Hunting while playing.
* Custom settings are available!

The mod is safe to add and remove mid-save!</description>
