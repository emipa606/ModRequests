QUANTUM COOLING REDUX

Version 2.2.0 (Unofficial)

(Japanese translation is no longer completely compatible with this version.)
(Building defs remained the same, update is compatible with existing saves.)

- Major updates and changes to the code of all buildables. Should no longer cause random errors.
- Removed dropdown menus for all quantum buildables.
- Removed support for game version 1.0
- Added 2 new buildings: Quantum Cooling Generator and Quantum Heating Generator with 1 new research to unlock them.
- Made Large Qantum Cooler and Heater minifiable (they can be un/installed and moved around without having to rebuild).
- Lots of minor changes and additions for my own sanity, too many to count.

	Balance Changes:

- Increased Small Quantum Cooler and Heater Plasteel cost from 10 to 25.
- Increased Large Quantum Cooler and Heater Hitpoints from 100 to 250.
- Doubled the work required to build everything.
- Reduced the flammability of everything to 10%
- Reduced the tick rate of everything to Rare (should improve performance when you have a bunch of quantum buildings).
- Adjusted Pathing Cost and Passability, Construction Skill Requirement, Cover Effectiveness and Mass for all buildables.

Version 2.1.2 (Unofficial)

- Added directional graphics to the Large Quantum Cooler and Heater.

Version 2.1.1 (Unofficial)

- Increased Prototype QC power draw from 200w to 300w.
- Increased the strength of all coolers and heaters.
- Increased the efficiency of all collers:
	Prototype QC - from 18.2w/eps to 12.5w/eps
	Small QC - from 15.2w/eps to 10.0w/eps
	Large QC - from 10.5w/eps to 8.0w/eps
	Small QH - from 7.1w/eps to 6.7w/eps
	Large QH - from 6.7w/eps to 5.0w/eps
	
- To compensate, increased research cost of all projects by 1000.
