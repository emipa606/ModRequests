  <description>This is a variation to Destroyed City that will change the textures to give more overgrown wild feel to the game. Their is less clutter and more natural landscape to the map. This mod may not be compatible with some other mods but can be place before Destroyed City 2 in the load order for an interesting change to both mods. this mod may not be save game compatible. </description>
