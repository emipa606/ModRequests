    <description>A rather famous book suggests that bushes can, in fact, burn. This logically means that you should at least be able to get some twigs from them. Sadly the kindling in Rimworld does get consumed when used as fuel.
	
Twigs will now drop from bushes, brambles, chokevine and alocasias which you craft into bundles for wood fuel applications and (less productive] than wood) chemfuel refining. Also a tiny amount of of hay will drop from tall grass. Clearing areas will be slightly more useful.

Should work fine on new saves and should be compatible with Seeds Please, Wild cultivation and anything that does not make bushes, brambles, chokevine, alocasia or tall grass harvestable.

Patching is even done to let the Grass Is Hay mod handle bushes and grass, which I updated for 1.2 here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2193891816
