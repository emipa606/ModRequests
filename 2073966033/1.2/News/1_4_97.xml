      |img:too-many-buttons|caption:The number of rows and columns of commands is now configurable.
      |Want a 10x10 grid of tiny commands? Now you can! (but you don't have to.)
      ||img:settings
      |The mod settings page now has fields for the number of commands per row and column, in addition to the scale setting it already had.
      |I've also added a keybinding setting that allows you to bind the palette to any key or mousebutton, and can include modifiers.
      |Want to bind the palette to Ctrl + LeftClick? Now you can! Want to use Alt + F4 as you hotkey? Give it a try! (I take no responsibility for lost save games. Please don't try Alt + F4.)
