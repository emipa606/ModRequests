Small mod to make kibble using any food ingredients without restrictions.
1 ingredient kibble require 2.25 nutrition to make instead of the standard 2.
In other words, 20 meat + 20 veggie for normal kibble or just 45 of one for 1 ingredient kibble.
The details on the recipe say 2 (which is a bug) but colonists will use 2.25.
Inspiration from "Hay is Kibble" and "Easy Kibble".
This is my first mod so I used the above mods to learn.
Should work on 1.3 but originally made for 1.1; let me know if you know how to fix the bug or if something doesn't work!
