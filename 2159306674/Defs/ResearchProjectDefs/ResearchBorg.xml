    <label>New types of Nanite Substrate</label>
    <techLevel>Spacer</techLevel>
    <description>Currently there is only one form of substrate for all activities. It functions as a universal medium for all Borg activity. I simply increased the costs of substrate in the mid and late game as you become more able to conquer enemies and make it more efficiently. Obviously, this is not the best solution. However, it is easy and allows for changes in post-production.
Originally there were different types of substrate acquired from different materials. There is still potential here, but I don’t want it to suck. I decided to focus my energy on other places, as I need playtesting and feedback for this part.
I am thinking about bringing in a second kind of substrate for valuable materials and spacer level tech. This would allow for late game development and may alleviate some of the issues with using one substrate.</description>

    <description>Playtesting is time consuming and balancing literally never ends! I end up spending most of my time on the mod in the early terrestrial part of the game. I want to develop the spacer stuff to add content on the back end of the game.
I am thinking about an additional spacer tier of weapons, armor, and buildings. It would require either boatloads of substrate or the new substrates or both.</description>

This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. I have no experience with much of this stuff, so I often put off work on these things.</description>
