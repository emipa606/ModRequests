#I love to use mods in Rimworld (obviously)! My mod was built with the compatibility in mind. You shouldn’t have mod conflicts. However, the Borg experience is very different from a typical playthrough, so many overhauls will simply have no impact. Resources and manufactured items added by mods may not be eligible for assimilation yet. I will do my best to add support for these mods, but none of it should be game-breaking.#

#Mods that change the difficulty of enemy faction bases or that change combat in some way will have a huge impact on gameplay. For example, powerful faction base (PFB) mod will create an early-game plateau effect. Tribal factions are important early prey for a basic Borg playthrough, but the default setting for PFB will make them too difficult to destroy without a serious force of Borg drones, which you cannot acquire until you have resources from destroying enemy faction bases. I personally enjoy PFB to keep things interesting in the mid game, but I normally only turn on that mod after I have conquered a couple of vanilla bases. Otherwise I will be forced to strip my starting map of ores and plants just to build a viable force!#

#This is a very combat oriented mod, so mods that significantly change combat will have a large impact on your play experience with Borg. If you use mods that increase the accuracy and/or mobility of your Borg then your Borg will become really strong really quickly. For example, if I use run and gun and/or combat updated and/or friendly fire tweaks then my Borg become a RWDS (RimWorld Death Squad). While running around a city automatically and instantly murdering any enemy pawn that stumbles into my field of fire is fun as hell, it can feel overpowered.#

#Finally, organs harvested from pawns are an important resource to the Borg. Mods that allow you to acquire more organs will create inflation. “Harvest organs post mortem”, “Harvest everything”, and even “RJW” will dramatically increase the number of organs you get, which will then dramatically increase the pace of the game.#

#You will need to use your best judgment and add/remove mods as needed.#
