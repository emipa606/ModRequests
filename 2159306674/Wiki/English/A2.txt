#The Borg are an alien race from the Star Trek universe. In many ways they are closer to a computer virus than an actual species. They reproduce through the process of assimilation wherein other alien races are forcibly captured and surgically transformed into half-organic and half-machine Borg drones. Their goals are simple: assimilate the technological and biological distinctiveness of other aliens in the galaxy into the uniform whole that is the Borg.#

#The Borg are one of the coolest and most horrifying alien races from all of science fiction. You can learn more about them from watching various Star Trek series from the 90s. You can also read about them on Memory Alpha.#
