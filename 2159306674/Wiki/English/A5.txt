#Keep an eye out for hapless travelers and caravans that arrive in your base. The Borg are adept fighters with access to advanced weapons and armor. A well-planned ambush with a disruptor cannon can devastate groups of enemies.#

#Assimilate captured pawns in order to create new Borg drones. You begin with a few nanite injections, which can be used to infect prisoners. If a pawn that is infected with Borg nanites dies then it immediately turns into a new Borg drone, complete with a hand plasma cannon!#
