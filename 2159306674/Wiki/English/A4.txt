#In the standard playthrough you begin with three Borg drones, a few minified buildings, and a couple of interesting items.#

#The Borg drones are interchangeable, so you do not need to manually specialize them for tasks.#

#Your first priority will be to create a sheltered space for your stuff. Borg can only build with substrate, but don’t build anything too elaborate! You won’t be here long.#

#You also start with three Borg beds (unilinks) and a substrate machine (nutrient synthesizer), which should be set up immediately.#

#The substrate machine is a multipurpose processor. Use it to turn items into substrate and to turn substrate into items. It also functions as a power generator that burns substrate for fuel.# 
@BorgAlcove@

#This machine is necessary for everything! You need it to create the food that Borg must eat.#
