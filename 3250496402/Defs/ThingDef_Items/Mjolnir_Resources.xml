"Project mjolnir is now entering its final stage. Both me and my colleagues have run various simulations and implemented everything that was needed to implement, now all that's left is to construct our prototypes.

Got to be honest, these prototypes are expensive as hell! I can't even imagine a normal human can procure these resources, luckily, we have our own mechs to provide everything we need but these expenses are enough to bankrupt a small country, well I guess these are perks for being a mechanitor hehe.

With the help of Fedinand's tunneler and fabricator mech, we have procured all the resources we need to gestate a few prototypes, hopefully we'll be done after 24 gestation cycles, and with Angela's centipedes, we'll be safe against whatever the mech hive sends at us for the time being.

Here's hoping that our efforts will bear fruit."</description>

      <description>It appears to be a research document for a project named "Project mjolnir". This document contains the progression of the project and it is written in a language that you can understand. The content of the project is as follows....
	  
"Angela is dead, her centipedes were pierced to oblivion, and so as her torso. Me and Ferdinand managed to escape using our cargo ships, but during our way of escape, one of the prototypes managed to reach us and were aiming at me. I thought i was dead, but Ferdinand took the hit for me, crazy bastard, you shouldn't have done that, and your wounds are too deep so I can't save you.

In the end, I was the only one who survived, and what's funny is that after the prototype's rampage, one of the mechs from the mech hive came in and claimed those prototypes to themselves. Suprise suprise! We were dancing in its palms all this time, FUCK! But you think I'll give up? Screw off! I'll perfect the prototype, just watch me! Humans aren't as fragile as you think we are!"

You skimmed through the document and reach the very end...

"I finished it! A mech micro-organ that will make the prototype immune to the mech hive's influence! Finally the project will reach its frution, but sadly, I'm out of supplies and the next planet is 300 lightyears away. Either way I'm fucked, malnutrition will claim me first before I could finish the damn project. To anyone who can read this, it is up to you to finish what me and my colleagues have started, just construct a transponder, fight one of the prototypes, and claim its subcore to understand how to gestate it.

Everything in the cargo ships will be yours, just finish the project and give that damn hive a run to its circuits."</description>
