  <description>Now you can mend in medieval times!

This mod is a simple patch for the MendAndRecycle mod.  This mod removes the complex mending recipes, and makes the simple recipes take longer, due to more primitive technology and the removal of the electricty cost.  In order to be able to mend, you will first need to research Smithing and ComplexClothing.

This mod will permit you to mend any clothing items, any armour items lower than flak (plate armour, wooden armour, simple helmet).
For weapons, you can mend any bows/crossbows and melee weapons (as long as they're from medieval tech or lower.  You will not be able to mend any firearms! This includes the musket and the flintlock despite being medieval era.

It is possible to unlock complex mending recipes upon completion of Machining research.</description>
