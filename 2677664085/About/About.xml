  <description>Introducing Hyper Shrooms and Hyper Flowers
  
Hypershrooms grow and glow in the dark and are harvest-able for an edible mushroom with the protien of meat.
Grow Days - 24, Sow Skill Min - 8, Harvest Yield - 10
Hypershrooms can be ground/smashed to produce hyperweave fibers at a tailoring bench.
50 Hypershrooms make 10 Hyperweave

Hyper Flowers produce hyperweave.
Grow Days - 30, Sow Skill Min - 12, Harvest Yield - 3

Why not a Hyperweave Floor? OK That too then... Less flammable and stays much cleaner than normal carpets.
