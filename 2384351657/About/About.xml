# Starship Troopers Remastered Weapons
Remastered/Retextured version of the Starship Trooper mods by KStrudel and ChickenPluckers.
Compatible with
1. Rimthreaded
2. Combat Extended
3. Almost everything else. It's a weapon/apparel mod. Duh.

#  FEDERAL NETWORK BROADCAST 
** Attention Citizens! **
Join the Mobile Infantry today and see if you got what it takes to be a citizen! The rimworlds need peacekeeping and what better way to do it than with the latest weapons the federation has to offer! So grab your guns, load your clips and shoot those bugs! Haven't you heard? There's a war going on! And we need you!

#  ARMORY CONTENT
- Morita MK1 Assault Rifle
- Morita MK1 Carbine (for Officers / Pilots)
- Morita MK1 Scoped
- Morita MK3 Assault Rifle
- Morita M34 Shotgun

#  POSSIBLE FUTURE PLANS
- Morita MK3 SAW LMG (as seen in the anime)
- Grenade launcher for MK1/MK3, but this depends on community demand. I don't code C# so would need help with this.
Suggestions are always welcome
