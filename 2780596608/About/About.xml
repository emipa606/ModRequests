  <description>Now introducing the Smokeleaf Bazooka! \n\n This bazooka features a single round of concentrated smokeleaf. Caution friends, this isn't just your average smokeleaf high - it's a concentrated EXTREME high. Your enemies will be left incredibly high, uncomfortably so! \n\n Unless, they are already an avid smokeleaf user - at which point they will just feel a normal high.</description>
