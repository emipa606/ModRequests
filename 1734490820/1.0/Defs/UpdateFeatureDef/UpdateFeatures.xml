&lt;b&gt;Fixes:&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Tweaks:&lt;/b&gt;

- Mixed race starting colonists now work for Lost Tribes scenario
- Added config option to blacklist specific races ("Excluded pawn kinds by race")
- Added Chinese translations.  (Thanks, CaptainSnafu!)

&lt;b&gt;Fixes:&lt;/b&gt;
- Different racial backstories no longer get mixed together.  The same goes for hair styles.
- Xenomorphs and Better Infestation's Queens are in the blacklist by default
- Blacklist config options now use a larger textbox

&lt;b&gt;Tweaks:&lt;/b&gt;
- Badly-behaving pawns (ones that attack their own faction) will get a debug warning that will include the defaultFactionType and race defName to use in one of the blacklists
- Blacklist filter displays will update their cache properly while entries are being changed
- Blacklist config options will detect defaults based on the previous mod version and upgrade them

		<content>&lt;b&gt;Additions:&lt;/b&gt;
- Added a config menu.  Now you can tweak which pawns are included in various groups.
- Replaced the caravan pack animal generation algorithm.  Now, trade caravan pack animals will vary in count based on the wares weight, will sometimes show up with a variety of pack animals, and will try to balance the cargo's weight without overloading themselves (usually).

&lt;b&gt;Fixes:&lt;/b&gt;
- The new Archotech Centipede from Genetic Rim is no longer a threat.  Unless you want to re-adjust the slider...

&lt;b&gt;Tweaks:&lt;/b&gt;
- A few more variations on faction names
- The herdAnimal property is no longer a factor in determining if they are appropriate in combat
- Since the pack animal algorithm has been replaced, body size is no longer a factor in determining appropriate caravan pack animals
