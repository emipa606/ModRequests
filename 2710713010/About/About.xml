	<description>A small mod aimed to add in a set of world sites to visit and plunder for loot, provided of course, you can defeat their defenders. Tribals, Insectoids, and a new race of ancient skeletons stand between you and magical bounty.

Dungeons can be found using the 'World Scanner,' a neolithic/magitech long range mineral scanner analog. The dungeons themselves are a set of pre-built graveyards, castles and classic styled dungeons.

Thanks to Tarenchuck for his coding prowess, Ambrosia for the treasure chest art, and Torann (of Rimworld of Magic fame) for his Skeleton textures. Also, thanks to Kasmex Forever for generously providing the preview image!
