	<description>This mod allows any game condition which has a temperature offset to affect conditions on the world map. It also comes with three new game conditions - Solar Apocalypse, Rogue Planet and Ice Age. There are also three starting scenarios which use these new game conditions, but you can also use them in your own scenarios.

Some game conditions may require you to build a spaceship to escape the searing heat or freezing cold.
	
You may need to have the appropriate insulation to survive if you send out caravans.


Solar Apocalypse

Solar activity increases at an alarming rate, creating a never-ending heatwave and runaway greenhouse effect.

This game condition slowly increases the temperature over the course of many years. At first this increase is quite small, but with each passing year the rise becomes more evident. 

In addition, fewer animals will migrate into your part of the world, and plants will become scarce. 

As even more time passes, your cooling systems will be unable to sink heat fast enough and this means you will be unable to grow crops or keep animals even indoors. Plants which are outside in the searing heat will die.


Rogue Planet

Through misfortune, this rimworld has broken from its orbit and is steadily escaping its parent star.

This game condition decreases the temperature over the course of many years. Like Solar Apocalypse, the decrease starts out small but gets bigger with each passing year.

Again, plant and animal density will decrease as the temperature gets lower.

Because of the nature of the map condition, less light will reach the surface and you will get less power from solar panels.

Temperatures will eventually reach -200C or lower.


Ice Age

A climate shift on this rimworld has led to much colder temperatures globally. This winter will never cease and, as the temperature drops, fewer and fewer animals and plants will be able to endure the cold. Additionally, less light reaches the surface, making solar panels less effective.
