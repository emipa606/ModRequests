Ideas for Future Updates:
Drink seawater
Melt ice harvested using Soil Relocation Framework into water

Known Bugs: (Don't know how to fix yet)
Some items might restore less thirst than expected. This depends on pawns' Food need - if it's somewhat full then items that also restore Hunger won't restore as much Thirst. 
No idea how to fix the disappearing DBH Water Bottle problem.

# *Update 1.4* The Simplification
Simplified thirst values in attempt to fix the "less thirst restoration" problem.
Now most things will restore 100% thirst except blood, hemogen, alcohol and non-drinks. (these restore either 50% or 5% thirst.)
There's a few exceptions to this rule, intentional.

Finally made Waterskins from Medieval Overhaul drinkable!
Pawns should now seek coffee, tea, hot chocolate and non-alcoholic drinks for thirst.
