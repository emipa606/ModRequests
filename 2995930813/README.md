# Seed-Vault

Adds two new deep storage items specifically for seeds

- Seed Vault: Storage converted into use as a seed vault. Contains lots of little containers just for seeds. Does not protect against deterioration if left outside. Can store up to 24 stacks of seeds.
- Outdoor Seed Vault: An advanced seed vault meant to hold seeds outside. Has a lid to protect the seeds from the weather and multiple trays inside, so it takes a little longer to store and find seeds. Can store up to 30 stacks of seeds.

Mod compatibility
- Requires LWM's Deep Storage.
- Requires SeedsPlease: lite.
- Optional: If Vanilla Furniture Expanded is installed, additional apperances for the Outdoor Seed Vault will be available.
