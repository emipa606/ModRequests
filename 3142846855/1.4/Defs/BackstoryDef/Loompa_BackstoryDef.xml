The only practical experience that [PAWN_pronoun] had was putting bandages over minor cuts. Fortunately, [PAWN_nameDef] had a knack for harvesting organs from anyone who vandalized the factory [PAWN_pronoun] worked in. So [PAWN_pronoun] managed to snag an official job.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] dealt with the finances for the factory [PAWN_pronoun] worked in. From what [PAWN_nameDef] could tell, the factory should have been in crippling debt due to how dealers kept on practically giving away their products for cheap and how everyone kept suing them for criminal negligence. But to [PAWN_possessive] surprise, the factory was well into the green, and the lawsuits seemed to magically disappear after enough time passed. [PAWN_nameDef] wanted to dive deeper, but considered the high turnover [PAWN_possessive] job had and decided against angering a high-ranking executive. Or maybe the high turnover was due to accountants being sent out in raiding parties for some reason.</baseDesc>
