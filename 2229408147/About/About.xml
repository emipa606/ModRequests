	<description>
Do you love your animals?
OF COURSE YOU DO!

Think they should be named as you take care of them?
OBVIOUSLY!

This mods lets your pawns name your animals while training them!

The frequency can be changed in the settings if you don't like the defaults!

Credits and thanks:
demwilson for pretty much all verbiage in the mod, the description, and the preview image background

Should be safe to add to and remove from games in progress.

No known incompatibilities. Should work with any animal packs as long as they aren't added as humanlike pawns.
