    <description>The scientists who raised [PAWN_nameDef] never spoke of the world outside, only of duty. [PAWN_pronoun] and a handful others were meant to inherit their knowledge and lead humanity’s return.
\nBut before the lessons were complete, the labs fell silent. And then the lights went out.</description>

\nWhile it was nothing compared to the true centers of power, it still could compare to some of the quieter, more utilitarian coreworlds. The cities stretched towards the sky, and the economy ran so smoothly that scarcity was little more than a concept from history lessons.</description>

\n[PAWN_pronoun] still remembers the name it once had, [PAWN_possessive] world—the real name, the one spoken with reverence. Not like that still matters. To the galaxy, it is just another ‘rimworld’.</description>

    <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was privileged enough to know what most never did—the war was not going as planned. The enemy’s psychic forces were beyond anything conventional strategy could counter. Every battle saw soldiers reduced to screaming husks, fleets torn apart by unseen forces.
\n[PAWN_pronoun] was among the most fervent advocates of the Super Soldier Initiative—a long-stalled enhancement program that had failed to produce stable results. Some subjects lost vision, others could no longer walk. Many simply died. But with the war nearing total collapse, refinement was no longer an option.
\nTo demonstrate full commitment, [PAWN_pronoun] placed [PAWN_possessive]self among the first to receive the enhancements.</description>

    <description>Even in an age of post-scarcity technology, there were still those who lived by the old ways. [PAWN_nameDef]'s father came from one of the few remaining clan families who still practiced the ancient warrior traditions—honing the body, mastering close combat, and living in harmony with the beasts they raised and hunted.
\nWhen [PAWN_nameDef] was conscripted, even the army made an exception for [PAWN_possessive] discipline, allowing [PAWN_pronoun] to focus on [PAWN_possessive] clan’s ways rather than standard training.</description>

    <description>[PAWN_nameDef] lived among the elite, one of the few who ruled from pristine sanctuaries while the rest of society toiled below. When collapse loomed, [PAWN_pronoun] tried retreating to one of [PAWN_possessive] many holdings across the stars.
\nBut the blockade came too soon. The ships never launched. With no other choice, [PAWN_nameDef] sought refuge in the vaults—trapped like everyone else.</description>

    <description>Although it was a subject of heavy debate before mandatory cryosleep, the scarcity of space and resources made natural births increasingly rare within the vault. Traditional childcare roles became obsolete, and specialists were forced to adapt.
\n[PAWN_nameDef] had been trained in early childhood development, but as demand for infant care dwindled, [PAWN_pronoun] was repurposed into the medical field. The transition was abrupt, but [PAWN_pronoun] adapted, applying pedagogical principles to patient care. Though now a medic, [PAWN_pronoun] still retains the instincts of an educator.</description>

\nThe job demanded precision, reinforcement protocols, and emergency repairs. Mistakes were unacceptable. When something failed, [PAWN_pronoun] was the one called to fix it before disaster struck.</description>

    <description>Food security was a constant concern in the vaults. Traditional agriculture was inefficient, and every resource had to be optimized. [PAWN_nameDef] specialized in hydroponics, genetic crop modification, and soil regeneration, ensuring that food production remained stable despite limited space and resources.
\n[PAWN_pronoun] spent years refining plant strains for faster growth, higher yields, and resilience to vault conditions. Every harvest was a test of [PAWN_possessive] work, every failure a potential crisis.</description>

    <description>In the vaults, food wasn’t just a necessity—it was a science. With limited space, strict rationing, and synthetic alternatives, every meal had to be carefully planned for efficiency and sustainability. [PAWN_nameDef] specialized in vault nutrition, ensuring that meals were not only edible but optimized for long-term health and morale.
\nCooking in such conditions required creativity. With fresh ingredients scarce, [PAWN_pronoun] learned to work with vat-grown proteins, hydroponic crops, and processed supplements, turning them into something that resembled real food. In a world of ration bars and nutrient paste, [PAWN_pronoun] made survival taste a little more like living.</description>
