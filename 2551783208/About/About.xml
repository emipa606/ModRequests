<description>Adds 30+ masculine hairstyles and 35+ feminine hairstyles to the game. This pack aims to give a varied distribution of hairstyle types without sticking to one main theme, such as within my other hair mods.
If you're looking for something more specific, you can find more of my hairstyle mods on the Steam Workshop! A big thank you to Chicken Plucker for the great tutorial on how to get this mod working!
