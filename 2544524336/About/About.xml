	This mod removes the tilled soil from Vanilla Plants Expanded and adds these new floors:
	- Farmland: 140% fertility, can be built soil, marshy soil and lichen-covered soil
	- Rich Farmland: 180% fertility, can only be built on rich soil
	- Poor Farmland: 100% fertility, can be built on sand and gravel
	
	Update 1/Dec/2021 - Added Poor Farmland, added all three versions as a dropdown group, added 'Diggable' tag to all farmlands, and added support to Advanced Biomes (Continued).
