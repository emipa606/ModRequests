A simple retexture for Beam me up, Scotty. I didn't really put too much effort into it, just did the bare minimum to make it look acceptable when used along other mods that I use. 
But hey, I have nothing to lose, I might upload it for those 5 weirdos that are gonna use it. 
This "mod" does contain patches, but they are just for the graphic data (drawSize, rotation etc.) and one lets you build the catcher with metals (it still accepts fabrics, didn't want it to brick existing saves).
