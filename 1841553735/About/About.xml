Generate larger faction bases. Their size and manpower evolve with time. It also factors in the difficulty level, and some randomness.

Safe to add/remove in-game.

For compatibility issues with other mods changing faction bases, check 'Choose your faction base' from BronkenBed.

Added Rim War patch to add variance to faction bases strength based on their settlement points.
