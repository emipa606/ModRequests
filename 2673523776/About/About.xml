  <description>This mod serves as a translation of PePeTan's SRTS Expanded Medieval mod. The original had its descriptions and labels in Korean. My update adds a little polish to the original, as well as overhauling construction and research costs.
  
  The mod adds three medieval-level techs: a primitive hot air balloon, a small military dirigible, and a merchant zeppelin. I reduced the silver and gold costs during construction but increased the wood and steel, as well as adding cloth and industrial components where appropriate.
  
  I increased the draw size of the hot air balloon, and increased the mass of each vessel. They can no longer be easily carried by a single pawn; if you want to haul your merchant zeppelin along on a caravan, you'll need to plan accordingly.
  
  Finally, for simplicity's sake, all of the vessels use wood for fuel. (If you have a mod that lets you burn e.g. charcoal or coal, these should work as well.) In real life, larger aerostats use gases e.g. helium or hydrogen. But for our purposes, they are wood-burning and use heated air rather than lighter-than-air gases.
  
  All credit for the original mod goes to PePeTan, and if they ask me to remove this update I will do so.</description>
