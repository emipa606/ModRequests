Infections are no longer immediately lethal, and instead scar the body part first.

Infections will scar body parts:
- Body part scarring occurs at 90-95% infection, unless immunity is developed.
- Scarring causes the infection to recede 2%, and deduct 0.5-2hp from the body part.
- Once a scar has fully disabled the body part (strength equal to hp), infections are lethal.

Pawns will not die from their very first infection, unless untreated.
- Pawns will die from an untreated arm (30hp) infection with immunity ending at about 90%.
- Pawns can potentially survive an untreated torso (40hp) infection.

Pawns may survive treatment without medicine, but will scar unless they are super-immune.
- No-medicine treatment could cause up to 20hp of scarring, depending on treatment quality.
- Some body parts (i.e. eyes) don't have the hp to cover this, therefore the pawn would die.

Mod can be removed from saves, but infection scars will remain.
