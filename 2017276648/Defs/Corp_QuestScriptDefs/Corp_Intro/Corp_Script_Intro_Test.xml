        <li>questDescription->[asker_nameFull], a [asker_royalTitleInCurrentFaction] of [asker_faction_name] is calling from nearby. [asker_pronoun] is being followed by an angry [animalKindDef_label]! [asker_pronoun] says [asker_pronoun] only wanted to see the landscape on a quick walk, and never expected such a deadly threat.\n\n[asker_nameDef] wants you to keep [asker_objective] safe at [map_definite] for a few hours until [asker_possessive] shuttle can come pick [asker_objective] up. [asker_pronoun] promises not to be offended by your body odors or lack of manners.
\n[asker_pronoun] will bestow [royalFavorReward] [asker_faction_royalFavorLabel] on whoever accepts this quest. This is enough favor to receive the corporate rank of Independant Contractor.  Its not enough to get any sort of reward or benefit, but it does at least get your foot in the door.
\nBe warned - those who rise in the ranks of the corporations become quite greedy, and demand only the best food, clothing, and accommodations!</li>
