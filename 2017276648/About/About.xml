	<description>Megacorp for Rimworld brings in a brand new faction - the Megacorporations! These spacer-tech conglomerates have sent a startup subsidiary corporation to your rimworld to open up new markets.  Will you side with them and reap the benefits, or try to stop them from buying everyone out (and/or murdering and enslaving them)?
	\nWatch out though.. there is more than one megacorporation that has opened up shop.  The other guys are.. well, more expansionistic.  If you aren't careful, you might find yourself the target of a hostile takeover!</description>
