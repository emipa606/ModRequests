	<description>Adds miscellaneous decor items to spruce up your bases visually, including artificial plants, candles, decorative windows, curtains and an aquarium. Window frames and curtains are paintable in 1.4, and the violets and candles can be placed on top of most furniture and buildings.

This should work without issue in earlier 1.x versions as well - it will just throw an error on startup regarding the 'paintable' tag. This has no effect in-game and can be ignored.

Update 01/01/2023: Added a non-powered aquarium and made houseplant pots and candle bases paintable.
