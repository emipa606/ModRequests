  <description>Ideology Content mod.

"Because my Elf should be able to handle a forest of Gauranlen Trees."

This mod will Re-Fix the Prune speed and link it to (Plant work speed) instead of (Global work speed)
i made this mod because past mods haven't updated to the new balancing fix(which totally made things worse, lol) and other mods were simply bad.

This mod is already broken without any addentional fixes, its intentionally made for Vanilla but sadly the speed increases "Catastrophically" when you have any PlantWork increasing factors, if you want to change this then you can edit this mod as you wish, its only 1 file anyways.</description>
