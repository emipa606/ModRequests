  <TwitchStoriesQuote1>A small group of humans thought they saw something shiny in your colony and they want it. But we all know they're just looking for an excuse to smash something.</TwitchStoriesQuote1>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote2>Volunteers from a distant rival colony are coming to raid you. Fortunately, not too many of them, I would guess about tree fiddy.</TwitchStoriesQuote2>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote3>In the distance you hear: ... spear shall be shaken, shield shall be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!!!!!

  <TwitchStoriesQuote18>At least the colonists have learned, that "licking your wounds" is not a literal saying. But at a price.</TwitchStoriesQuote18>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote19>Mosquitos are like family. Annoying, but they carry your blood.</TwitchStoriesQuote19>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote20>Looks like the 5 second rule is not a thing here. As you hear: "Hey, I can still eat thi...Hoouuwwéééh", you see half of the colony's stomachs turn inside out. </TwitchStoriesQuote20>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote29>The weather is clearing up, go outside and PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/</TwitchStoriesQuote29>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote30>Is god literally taking a piss or is this a blessing from the plant gods?</TwitchStoriesQuote30>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote36>Some unnatural weather has just occurred. A rain cloud is hanging one meter over the ground. Your colonists can feel the rain being created on them. </TwitchStoriesQuote36>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote37>Someone in your colony has played a "prank" and charged up enough static electricity to trigger lightning strikes. I wonder who it was...</TwitchStoriesQuote37>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote38>Is the moon blocking the sun, or is this the death star looking for a parking spot?</TwitchStoriesQuote38>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote40>The RimWorld gods decided to give some feedback on your colony...</TwitchStoriesQuote40>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote42>Some form of alien just landed in the area. Closer inspection reveals it's a dead {material} alien. In fact it's just {material}... But I WANT TO BELIEVE.</TwitchStoriesQuote42>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote43>If someone throws a stone at you, throw a flower at them. But remember to throw the flower pot along with it.</TwitchStoriesQuote43>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote44>One of your plants caught the flu - looks like you didn't vaccinate them. Guess you have to pay the price for this now...</TwitchStoriesQuote44>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote45>Shower thought: If the sun would be alive, would solar flares be kisses or a sneeze? </TwitchStoriesQuote45>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote46>Volcanic winter is a reduction in global temperatures caused by volcanic ash and droplets of sulfuric acid and water obscuring the Sun. That's wikipedia's language for "DAMN nature, you scary". </TwitchStoriesQuote46>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote59>A herd of {animal} is on it's way to the abyss and will travel through the area.</TwitchStoriesQuote59>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote60>Did you know? A group of bears is called a sloth, but a group of sloths doesn't have a herd noun because they are too lazy group up.</TwitchStoriesQuote60>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote61>What sounds more real? A horse with a simple horn on its forehead or a long neck, fabulous fur and a giant axe on its forehead. You decide.</TwitchStoriesQuote61>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote62>You always wanted a pet? Or {amount}? Well, I guess today is your lucky day.</TwitchStoriesQuote62>

  <TwitchStoriesQuote69>No no, I am definitely not insane, it is just the drone...</TwitchStoriesQuote69>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote70>Every colonist gets the feeling when you've got an unknown song in your head all day, and then finally figure out what song it is.</TwitchStoriesQuote70>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote71>I have not lost my mind. Half of it just wandered off and the other half went looking for it.</TwitchStoriesQuote71>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote72>Honestly, I don't even play an active role in my life anymore... Things just happen and I'm like "Oh, is this what we're doing now? Ok."</TwitchStoriesQuote72>
  <TwitchStoriesQuote73>Sometimes I question my sanity, but the unicorn and gummy bears told me I'm fine!</TwitchStoriesQuote73>
