	<TD.ExplainHomeBeds>Use Bedrolls will remember assigned beds in the caravan's home colony. By default, the unmodded game does keep the bed assigned to a traveler, but it is cleared when they use another bed. Use Bedrolls will reclaim their bed when they return, if it is still unassigned.</TD.ExplainHomeBeds>
	<TD.SettingReclaimAggresively>Reclaim home beds even if they were claimed by someone else</TD.SettingReclaimAggresively>
	<TD.SettingReclaimAggresivelyDesc>Obviously you can't claim beds that were made to be for medical or prisons</TD.SettingReclaimAggresivelyDesc>
	<TD.SettingUnAssignOnExit>Unassign beds when you exit the map</TD.SettingUnAssignOnExit>
	<TD.SettingUnAssignOnExitDesc>An obvious choice when your caravan is forming a new colony - and not a problem anyway if you use the above option to reclaim</TD.SettingUnAssignOnExitDesc>

	<TD.SettingFarFromBedAmount>Use inventory bedroll if assigned bed is at least this far away:</TD.SettingFarFromBedAmount>
	<TD.SettingAlsoColonies>Use bedrolls on colony maps</TD.SettingAlsoColonies>
	<TD.SettingAlsoColoniesDesc>This mod is really supposed to be used for caravans, but it works on home maps all the same, but you usually already have assigned beds, but that wasn't the intention anyway so it's off by default, but sure you can turn it on I guess</TD.SettingAlsoColoniesDesc>	<TD.UseBedrollsUpdated>Use Bedrolls updated</TD.UseBedrollsUpdated>
	<TD.UpdateNewsColonyMaps>Hey! Quick note. There's a new setting to use bedrolls on colony maps - it defaults off, so {0} is not looking for uninstalled beds right now.</TD.UpdateNewsColonyMaps>
