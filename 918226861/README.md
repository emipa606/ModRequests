# Star Wars - The Force

# Adds RPG-leveling, alignment, and force powers to RimWorld.


# ::::: Load Order :::::
Star Wars mods need to go below JecsTools. 
Putting Cults below The Force fixes alignment issues.

Thanks to Jedi Master Ailan for his direction and inspiration in the creation of this mod. Without his help and support this would have never happened.

# Quick start notes:

For a character to gain force powers, they must start with the force sensitive trait. After spending time working, they will discover their force powers through gaining force XP. Low level force powers can be used by both dark and light sides of the force. Penultimate powers are restricted for pure dark or pure light force wielders.
