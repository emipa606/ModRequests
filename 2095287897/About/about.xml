 <description>
Add 21 vanilla animals as synthetic animals.

Synthetic animals are around 25% stronger than normal animals, so be more careful. 

Spawnrate is 20% of the normal animals.

On butchering you get steel, components, plasteel and synthread instead of meat and leather.

Amount of resources get from butchering depend on the animal size.

Give the option to farm animals for resources.
