# Introduction

This mod enhances the Create Xenogerm menu of the Gene Assembler building to give a hollistic view into customizing a Xenogerm for a specific existing Pawn.

It puts a prompt at the top where you can select a specific pawn. It will add sections to the menu, showing the pawn's Bio and Germline genes.

It will conditionally grey out those Germline genes to indicate when they are interacting with a selected Xenogene.

At the bottom of the page, it will have the final resulting Metabolic Efficiency when the given Xenogerm is installed into the selected pawn, considering their Germline genes.

When assembling the Xenogerm, the Gene Assembler will display the pawn that was selected.

When the reassembly is finished, the Xenogerm item will also display the pawn that was selected for it.
