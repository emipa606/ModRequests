	<description>Pawns may now choose to take a nap during the day. Pawns have different preferences for taking naps and are more likely to take naps when they are tired, uncomfortable, in pain, and have had plenty of recreation. Restful naps give pawns good thoughts and a small boost to consciousness, but sometimes pawns will wake up groggy, suffering a negative thought instead.
