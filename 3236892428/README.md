Have you ever wondered why your intellectual colonists who have researched the secrests of the universe, or the crafters of your colonies who have produced artifacts of such quality that news of them spreads across the lands, can't seem to craft bionic equipment that has above standard efficiency?

Well, now you don't have to wonder any longer! Introducing quality bionics! Stronger bionics for smarter people.

Prostheses at bionic level and above now have quality levels that affect the efficiency of the part. Because, let'ss face it, someone had to have figured out a way to make a circuit in the unit a little bit better.

## Known mod incompatibilities

-   Elite Bionics Framework -- interferes with the way this mod works. I'm working towards adding a compatibility patch.[^ebf]
