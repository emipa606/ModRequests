## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2024-05-20

### Fixed

-   Use `__args` in `RecipeWorker_ApplyOnPawn` patch instead of named parameters so that subclasses renaming parameter names won't matter.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-05-18

### Fixed

-   EBF compatibility should be back after adding a compatibility layer so it can keep pretending the mod is like it was in 1.4.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-04-30

### Added

-   Ported [original mod](https://github.com/SirRebelRabbit/Quality-Bionics) from 1.4 to 1.5
