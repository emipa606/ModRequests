		<content>The game is likely to throw 2 errors after you load a game the next time:\n    1. In my crusade against technical debt, some humans may have lost their tails. You can simply implant a new one.\n    2. An unused research has been removed.\n\n Neither of those break the savefile!</content>

		<content>A new setting was added. When activated it allows you to put different arms on the lower shoulders, lungs into the left chest cavity and hearts into the right chest cavity.\nThere also appeared to be some issue with Questionable Ethics Enhances which has been fixed. Sorry about that.</content>

		<assemblyVersion>2.0.3</assemblyVersion>
		<content>A patch has been added that combines EVOR with the mod "Ultratech: Altered Carbon Remastered". From now on you can use the Organ Incubator from that mod to create all organs. You might get some red errors the first time the save is loaded that can be ignored.</content>

		<assemblyVersion>2.0.4</assemblyVersion>
		<content>Since there is now a working QEE version is out, I had to update the workbenches again.\nYou can now select the workbench you want to use in the settings menu. When you got an error, don't save the game, go into the settings menu for EvolvedOrgansRedux and choose the workbench you have been using until now. After changing that setting you need to restart the game.</content>
