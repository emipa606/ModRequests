The Obliterator mod adds the Obliterator rifle.
This weapon deals minimal damage but is guaranteed to destroy a randomized body part of the target.

You could be an unstoppable god, shooting the heads of your opponents shot after shot or you could be unlucky and only obliterate fingers and other non-lethal body parts.
The Obliterator is unforgiving!
      
By default the chance to destroy a body part is set to 100% on hit, but this can be configured in the mod settings.
