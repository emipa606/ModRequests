      <description>The undead Forsaken or simply the Forsaken, are a race and a faction of intelligent undead who broke away from the Scourge. And then took control of much of the kingdom of Lordaeron, which destroyed during the Third War by the death knight Arthas. While comprised vastly of undead humans, the Forsaken are a diverse faction that include several different races at their biological core. However, they have all assumed their racial identity as "Forsaken," due to their shared goals and loyalties.</description>
