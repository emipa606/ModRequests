  <RiftRefugee_Hostile>{PAWN_nameDef} is from your enemy {PAWN_factionName}. You can capture {PAWN_objective} for recruitment or slavery purposes.</RiftRefugee_Hostile>
  <RiftRefugee_NonHostile>{PAWN_nameDef} is from {PAWN_factionName}. If you rescue {PAWN_objective}, {PAWN_pronoun} may join freely. Otherwise, {PAWN_pronoun} will return home and spread goodwill between your factions.\n\nYou can also capture {PAWN_objective} for recruitment or slavery purposes, but this will anger {PAWN_possessive} faction.</RiftRefugee_NonHostile>
