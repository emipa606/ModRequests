	This mod is a combination of all my unbalanced stuff, in particular it adds a couple metals, a metal cloth, and now a firearm to the game which are completely overpowered and unbalanced.  If I wanted balanced stuff I wouldn't use mods nor play single player games really.  I mean, for me, single player games are fantasy for a reason.
