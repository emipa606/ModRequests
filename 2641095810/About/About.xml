		Waiting for an invitation to arrive

		Waiting for an invitation to arrive
		Goin' to a party where no one's still alive

		I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
		I was hit by something last night in my sleep
		It's a dead man's party who could ask for more
		Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
		Leave your body and soul at the door

		Don't run away it's only me
		Only me, only me
