<description>Adds the option to assign your pawns to carry other things besides medicine. You can also manually force colonists to pick up items that that can be carried. The carriable items selection is quite limited; it only offers the vanilla handguns/small melee weapons and all of the special weapons and artifacts. This mod utilizes the new vanilla carrying mechanic, so it should be compatible with every 1.3 mod out there.</description>
