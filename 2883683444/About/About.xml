Standalone version of the buildings from my Gene Variety mod, as updated by Uncle Jack Hughes.

Adds the Gene Archive and Register, advanced gene banks that can hold up to 24 and 80 genes instead of 4, respectively, though at a higher cost in material, power, and space.

Adds a Gene Macroprocesser and Gene Subprocesser, advanced gene processors that improve genetic complexity by 8 and 4 respectively instead of 2, though at a higher cost in material, power, while the subprocesser makes for far more efficient use of space.

Added compatibility between Biotech Cloning Mod's Clone Extractor building and the attachable buildings of this mod. It's a great mod, go check them out.

Added ability for traders to view and buy genes directly from archives and registers, with a configuration option to disable, enabled by default. All credit to Uncle Jack Hughes.

Mod Version 1.5
