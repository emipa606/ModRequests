		<description>A meal cooked and secured in a steel can effectively extending shelf life indefinitely. \nCanned meals require more work to make and are heavier than other canned goods, and cannot be used as an ingredient. Compared to packaged survival meals, they are heavier and require more work to make, but do not require a minimum cooking skill. \n\nNote that these meals cannot be made in the cannery machine if VFE mechanoids is installed. In that case, just use the conveyor oven and make packaged meals, as they are strictly better.</description>
