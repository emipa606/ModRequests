Allows building floors out of stuff*.

![Important](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Important.png)  

You can safely add this mod to you save games, but *you can not remove it* from save games. (If you really must do this, you'll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).

![Features](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Features.png)  

This mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed.

**For players**
Adds several new floors, and existing floors from Telkir's [More Floors](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725623521), CuproPanda's [Extra Floors](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=13400#msg135940) and Pravus' [Fences and Floors](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=784370602) in all types of stone, metal, wood.

Works great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. [Minerals and Materials](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728233992) [Kura's Extra Minerals](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=852103845), [Extended Woodworking](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836912371), [Vegetable Garden](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822470192) and [GlitterTech](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725576127).

This mod also organizes and where needed, removes non-stuffed versions of the floors added by RimWorld, [More Floors](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725623521), [Extended Woodworking](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836912371), [Minerals and Materials](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728233992), [GlitterTech](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725576127), [More Furniture](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=739089840), [Vegetable Garden](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822470192), and [Floored](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801544922).

Other mods can easily add more floors using existing materials, or completely new types of materials.

**For modders**
Adds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. Removing now obsolete terrainDefs and/or architect categories is also easily handled. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fluffy-mods/StuffedFloors/wiki/For-Modders) for a guide on using Stuffed Floors in other mods.

![Known issues](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Known%20issues.png)  

While this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, please let the author(s) of said mod(s) know so that they can correctly set up their designator groups!

![Are you enjoying my mods?](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Are%20you%20enjoying%20my%20mods%3F.png)  

Normally, this is where I ask you to show you appreciation by buying me a coffee.

These are not normal times. Ukraine is being invaded by Russia, at the whim of a ruthless dictator. Innocent people are loosing their lives, and fighting for their continued freedom.

This is not a matter of politics. This is not a debate. Putins' bloody campaign in Ukraine is illegal, and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants, when he wants it, no matter the cost. The Russian army is invading a country without provocation, bombing civilians and murdering innocents.

The prospect of waking up to see my country at war is alien to me, as it must have seemed to most Ukrainians. I can do little to influence the outcome of current affairs, but I will do whatever I can.

**I ask you to join me in supporting the people of Ukraine**

![Humanitarian Aid](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Humanitarian%20Aid.png)  

If you can, donate to the various charities providing humanitarian aid. If you don't know where to donate, Global Citizen maintains a list of charitable organizations active in the region.

![Speak up](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Speak%20up.png)  

Leaders around the world are deciding on how to respond to Putins' aggression. They are balancing their conscience, and their desire to be re-elected. Many are afraid to impose heavy sanctions because the economic repercussions might loose them votes. The Dutch government, my government, has hinted that they are unwilling to accept Ukranian refugees, and has played a part in allowing Russia to have continued access to international finance. I am ashamed of these actions, taken in my name.

Whereever your live, please let your government know you care more about supporting the people of Ukraine than you do about the price of gas. Join a protest, write letters, call your representatives, and show them that you care about justice!
