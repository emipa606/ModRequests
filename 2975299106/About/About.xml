Have you got a baby that's endlessly ravenous? You try to give it baby food but by the time it's finished eating it's starving again and mums asleep because all she has time for is feeding the little monster spawn and sleeping now. Worse she's running out of milk and barely keeping up. You're losing hope faster than that baby is losing its hunger bar! You can't keep up!

Fear not! I come to you with a solution that will satisfy your baby! It's still going to need extra care because of the increased hunger rate, but this will make it less of a monumental feat.


TWO NEW BABY FOODS TO CHOOSE FROM:

BIG BABY FOOD has twice the nutrition and therefore twice the fullness of regular baby food. This is great for hungry custom Xenotype babies. Especially if you're using a crazy amount of mods like I am.

MEGA BABY FOOD has twice the nutrition of Big Baby Food, and therefore four times more fullness when compared to regular baby food. This one is great for people those using the Need Bar Overflow mod! Hooray!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Did you tick one of these on the feeding tab so baby can eat it?
2. Did you untick other baby foods from the feeding tab so baby is only eating this?
