				<label>Psionic Lich</label>
				<description>[PAWN_nameDef] is a Psionic Lich. 
					Psionic liches are undead psionics users—usually psions, but sometimes psionic monsters—who have interred their mentality into the necrotic tissue of their once-living bodies, thus preserving their existence indefinitely.
					A psionic lich appears in some ways as it did in life: Its flesh remains pliant, soft, and warm to the touch. However, it has no heart, and no blood flows through its veins—it is psionic power that animates the flesh. If you cut a psionic lich, its veins are empty of blood, though stray sparks of power flash briefly. Its eyes are always completely silvered and glowing with a faint radiance. A psionic lich wears clothing for simple modesty or disguise, not to protect it from the environment. Thus, many wear only simple leggings, tunics, and sandals, if that. Psionic liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.</description>
