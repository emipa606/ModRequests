Patch types: Expansion, vanilla repair

Expansions:
- Adds use of the generic bionic tails from this expansion mod.
- Added cosmetic tox wings.

Vanilla repair:
- "Tail" body part is a vanilla def used by animals, being overwritten by this race mod.
Added the vanilla version back by forced overwrite to repair it, as this mod is loaded after the race mods.
- Added new ToxTail, and now uses this body part in place of the "Tail" body part.
