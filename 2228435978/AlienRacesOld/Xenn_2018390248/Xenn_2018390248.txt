Patch types: Expansion, repair, vanilla repair

Expansions:
- Now uses the generic bionic tail from this expansion mod, to reduce item spam.
- Added advanced bionic tail, using the generic advanced bionic tail item of this expansion mod.
- Added existing hediff graphics for the advanced bionic tail.

Repair:
- Removed set market price of ClothTail and BionicXennTail, so market value are aligned with material cost.

Vanilla repair:
- "Tail" body part is a vanilla def used by animals, being overwritten by this race mod.
Added the vanilla version back by forced overwrite to repair it, as this mod is loaded after the race mods.
- Added new XennTail, and now uses this body part in place of the "Tail" body part.
