Repairs:
- Removes Stomach item from the race mod file with specific xpath targeting.
This item is unused throughout the mod, and overwrites EPOE-Forked's version.

Notes:
Wanted to remove duplicate surgery defs, but normal insects are completely tied in with them.
Can't do a clean removal that specifically targets those, and manually doing it affects the reciperUser inherit.
