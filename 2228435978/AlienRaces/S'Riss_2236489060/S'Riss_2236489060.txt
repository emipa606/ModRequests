Patch types: Expansion, repair, vanilla repair

Expansions:
- Now uses the generic bionic tail from this expansion mod, to reduce item spam.
- Added advanced bionic tail, using the generic advanced bionic tail item of this expansion mod.
- Optimizers can be applied on natural tail.

Repair:
- Natural S'Riss tail can now be installed. Was missing surgery.
- False S'Riss tail can now be installed. Was missing surgery.
- Bionic S'Riss tail can now be installed. Was missing surgery.
- Fixed bionic S'Riss tail to be bionic tier in research and tech level.
- Removed set market price of false and bionic S'Riss tail, so market value are aligned with material cost.
- Removed graphics tags from natural, false and bionic tail, so they don't all look the same and follow their tier textures.

Vanilla repair:
- "Tail" body part is a vanilla def used by animals, being overwritten by this race mod.
Added the vanilla version back by forced overwrite to repair it, as this mod is loaded after the race mods.
- Added new SRissTail, and now uses this body part in place of the "Tail" body part.
