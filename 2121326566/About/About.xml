	No drugs, operations or other medical stuff, so should be compat. and work as a extension to mods like EPOE and such.

	Any old items from colab mod should still be there if you install this and uninstall those mods, research may be lost though.
	since i made a combined system for less clutter in research.
	
	Those mods where just one or more items are borrowed will still work if install full mod. (this should be considered a lite version of those)
