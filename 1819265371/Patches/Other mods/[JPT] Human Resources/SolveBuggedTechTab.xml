                            <description>This is just a tech to prevent a bug when using [JPT] Human Resources. If this wasn't here, chances are that the tech tab on your pawns who know nothing would be bugged out, as they were during testing. I have contacted jptrrs, and he is looking into it, but in the meantime, this is the solution I came up with.</description>
