		Total Terrain Texture Overhaul.  Legacy Terrain Overhaul replaces all terrain textures with improved models.  Also adds multiple new floor textures to the game - accessable via Tile menu.  Each with its own unique stats, including Mud for slowing down enemies and Farm Fields for growing your crops.  This complete overhaul balances visuals with realism to create an unmatched Rimworld experience.
		
		Enjoy the mod, and as always..  RIM it UP!
