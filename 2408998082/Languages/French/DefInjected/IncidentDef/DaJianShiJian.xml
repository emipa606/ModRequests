<SZ_NianShouRuQin.Text>According to the mythology of Shenzhou, at the end of each year, a vicious Nian beast will come to the colony to make trouble, and now, a Nian beast has come to your colony, it will not take the initiative to attack the colonists for the time being , but it will frantically prey on nearby animals and eventually destroy the colony's ecosystem. Therefore, please take quick measures to repel this ferocious Nian beast. \n\nTip: Nian will take four times the damage of fire and explosion, so you can choose some explosion or fire weapons to deal with it.</SZ_NianShouRuQin.Text>
