<ChineseA.description>A difficult game difficulty. In this case, the wealth value has a weaker impact on the game, replaced by a fixed and strong attack intensity.

Suggested use:
-Players who want to work step by step and play steadily instead of reaching the sky one step at a time
-Players who donâ€™t want to be constrained by wealth and want to have a stronger challenge
-Players who want to see tragedy and comedy coexist, and the script is more modest
\n\nChinese Confucianism once said:The so-called cultivating nature, preserve the heart of innocence, and cultivate the nature of kindness. Furthermore, the mean is the mean if it is not partial, and the mean if it is not easy. In order to adapt to this difficulty, you need to adjust the previous strategic deployment and game ideas.
\n\nAt this intensity, the adaptive growth and adaptive impact will be lower, but the attack intensity will be higher, and at the same time, your villain will get a very small mood gain. The Chinese people emphasize self-cultivation and health, so your income from planting and mining will increase slightly. In addition, the rage rate will be lower and the frequency of diseases will be lower. But on the other hand, the speed of scientific research will be relatively reduced, the probability of food poisoning and infection will correspondingly increase, and the enemy will be more likely to die directly when it falls to the ground.
\n\nBut in general, compared with the last two difficulties, this difficulty will be more challenging in the early stage, but when you build a certain defense facility, you will be much easier.</ChineseA.description>
