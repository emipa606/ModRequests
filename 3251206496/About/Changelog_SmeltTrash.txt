Type Writer - Smelt Trash

v1 - Initial Release
Two recipes added
	Campfire: Reclaim Steel - Converts 5 trash bags into 5 steel as a cooking operation.
	Smelter (Includes both Fueled and Electric): Reclaim Steel - Same as above, but requires only half the work.
Patch - Fertile Fields
	Two recipes added
		Crafting Spot: Process Biopacks - Converts 5 Reclaimed Biopacks into 1 Fertilizer. This allows for the same ability to fertilize soil as already provided by Biopack decay, but in a much more reliable and stable manner. Uses general crafting worktype, with butchering graphics.
		Stonecutter's Table (both Standard and Electric) - Same as above, but requires only half the work.
Patch - Medieval Overhaul
	Both "Trash bags to steel" recipes are patched to become "Trash bags to iron ore." This maintains parity with MO's resource economy, and it felt more appropriate than direct ingot conversion.
	
v2 - Hotfix
Minor syntax error; I made the medieval overhaul patch optional after personal testing, but then didn't test that it still functioned the same way before publishing. (I had to change the sequenced operations from the "operation" tag to the "li" tag.) This has now been corrected, and the mod should fully function as described in v1.

v3 - The update that wasn't
I didn't actually release this version; it would have just been me updating the version number from v1 to v2 because I forgot to do that when publishing the v2 hotfix. And doing so would have made this v3 instead. Honestly, it just felt like a waste of time.

v4 - Rimworld 1.5 update
Added 1.5 tag, thanks to testing from -=GoW=-Dennis.
Patch - Fertile Fields
	Added a second patch for the current 1.5 version of Fertile Fields (currently maintained by Greysuki,) using the same method. Having either version loaded should work as intended, potentially even both at the same time, but why would you do that
