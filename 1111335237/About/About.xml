WillWow_mc's Vault Stuff.
 
Includes: vault gear door, vault interior blast door, vault interior hydrolic door, marked vault doorway concrete, vault interior wall, two vault metal floors, vault concrete, and ruined variants of all of these.

Also includes Wattz Electrobox (vault generator, runs on uranium but is quite efficient), and vault door control pod, which is just for looks.

All the doors have the correct in-game sounds. All sprites are either hand-made with colours referenced to match with the original textures, or rendered from models.

All require research, with ruined variants being a seperate research project to avoid cluttering for people who don't want to use them.

NOTE: If you want quieter doors, I have a separate file up on the Workshop that goes below this in the load order.
