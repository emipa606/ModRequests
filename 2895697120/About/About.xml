    <description>Yeah, yeah ... Mechanitor functionality is tied to psychic power, blah blah blah.  But to hell with that!  
	
If you want to roleplay a technology loving people who dislike magic, then this mod is for you!

This mod makes one simple change to the Mech Link Def, it removes the restriction that prevents the Mech Link from being installed in a Psychically Deaf pawn.

Disclaimer, I made this mod for me.
