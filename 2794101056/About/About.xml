	<description>What happens when you don't want to make the mother of all omelettes? Perhaps you simply wish to get in touch with your inner child, or just pass on your memes.
	
	Adds Sundowner, Mistral, Monsoon, and Jetstream Sam's cyborg implants in the form of spine bionics.
	
	I also recommend I Exist's "Nanomachines, Son!" mod to get Senator Armstrongs Nanomachine heart, and Armor and UI uncapper to make full use of the powerful bionics.
