While the lingering fear of Cthulhu is most unnerving, you are not alone. Secretive coastal fishing villages and bases of operations for The Agency have begun to appear across the rimworlds. While the villages are not fond of outsiders, should you trade with them, you might acquire large hooks, branding irons, flare guns, or even a harpoon. The Agency come attired in stylish trench coats, fedoras, bowler hats, and wield revolvers to put down potential threats. Have fun!

Also, special thanks to the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=745193823andsearchtext=]fashionrimsta team for working with us to help make more outfits.
