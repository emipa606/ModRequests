  <description>Adds a larger solar panel that better fits into wind farms. Originally created by Thorbane. Updated by cucumpear for Dellamorte78.n/n/Now (finally) with variants that will fit the new Wind turbine dimensions and even a tiled version (note that each tile is a separate building), and the tiles are a bit more expensive than "normal" solar gens.</description>
