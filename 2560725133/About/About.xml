	<description>
Your colonists will automatically strip corpses of their weapons, equipment, inventory, and apparel upon (or after) hauling them.
Ideal for scavenger or cannibal colonies who don't want to manually assign strip orders after every battle!

Smeltable and non-smeltable tainted apparel can be configured to be auto-forbidden, left on the corpse, or auto-magically destroyed upon haul as well, if you would rather not deal with tons of useless tainted clothes after every battle.

Compatibility
*0% performance impact (0.000ms on strip in Dub's Performance Analyzer).
		
*Safe to add and remove mid-game.
		
*Designed to be mod safe, with no modifications to vanilla behavior/code required. Works by calling the same code the vanilla "Strip" command does, so should be compatible with anything.
		
*Independent, isolated, and minimal in scope: This mod leaves no permanent changes to your saved game, will not break your game, nor conflict with other mods.
		
*Confirmed compatible with Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, Dubs series, Simple Sidearms, and hundreds more.
		
*NOT compatible with Non Uno Pinata because it is doing the same thing as this mod.


Updates
~3.0 update: Now compatible with 1.5! Added option for undropped apparel to be left on the corpse vs. destroyed. Reworded settings options to be less confusing.
~2.0 update: Now compatible with 1.4!
~1.4 update: Added auto-forbid inventory option, which should be useful for mods that keep items on pawns after death and for Simple Sidearms that puts extra weapons into the inventory.
~1.3 update: Added strip after haul option.
~1.2 update: Added auto-forbid equipment option.
~1.1 update: Added auto-forbid tainted option. Added auto-destroy smeltables option.
