	<description>This mod makes end tables and dressers more important by reducing the base comfort of beds, hospital beds, royal beds, and bedrolls. In vanilla, a normal bed by itself is sufficient to be "quite comfortable" and an excellent bed by itself is sufficient for "luxuriantly comfortable." With this mod, a normal bed is merely "comfortable" and an excellent bed is "extremely comfortable." You will now need an excellent bed with an end table and a dresser to reach luxuriantly comfortable. An excellent hospital bed will now need either an end table or a dresser to reach luxuriantly comfortable. Similarly, a good royal bed will need either an end table or dresser to reach luxuriantly comfortable. An excellent royal bed will still be luxuriant without other furniture.
	
I have not tested this mod with any other bed mods. However, it should be compatible with mods that add new textures of beds or change the cost of beds, but not with mods that add beds of varying comfort levels.
