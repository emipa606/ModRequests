	<description>Furniture list:

- Animal Nano Bed
- Nano Bed
Rapid healing beds that use perishable nanobots

- MFS Cell
Portable Microfusion Storage Cell that requires plenty of components to build

- MFS Lamp
A lamp based on the MFS Cell design

- Aerospace Heater
- Aerospace Cooler
3x more effective than the normal heater and cooler, but requires more power

- UAC Hydroponics

Special thanks to NestOfMoon for updating this to B18.

Notes: Nano Pod removed due to errors that will stay unfixed. 
The bed will be replaced with a craftable UAC Nano Healer item for the upcoming UAC Kit, also available in DOOM Factions.
