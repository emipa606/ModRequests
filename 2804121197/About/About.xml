	<description><![CDATA[TraderGen is a mod focused on improving trader variety and mod compatibility. Every trader will feel different and unique!

Orbital trader specializations: Orbital traders get a random specialization. In addition to their normal stock, they will have extra items fitting their specialization. Some of these specializations carry rare or useful items! Keep an eye out for them.

Orbital ship names: Orbital ships gets an improved range of randomly generated names. Each different type has their own selection, so you will see more fitting names as well.

Ideology support: With the [Ideology DLC](https://rimworldgame.com/ideology/), traders will expand their stock depending on the ideoligion they follow. For example, Tunnelers will sell insect meat and raw fungus, while Transhumanists will have bionics in stock. Ideologies against cannibalism will refuse to purchase human meat, while those with Tree connection will never commerce with wood. More than 50 precepts from Vanilla and multiple Ideology mods are supported!

Mod compatibility: TraderGen features extensive mod compatibility, with a growing selection of mods having additional effects on trader stock.

Customization: You can tweak TraderGen to your liking; every feature can be tweaked, enabled or disabled in the mod settings.

You can find a detailed description of specializations, ideology features, trader tweaks and mod compatibility features in the project website.
