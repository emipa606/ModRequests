  <description>
A collection configurable food-related features. Add meals to pawn schedules. If it's close to meal time, pawns will try to wait to eat until dinner. During meal time, pawns will eat sooner than they normally would, and will prefer social and gluttonous recreation. Food selection tweaks cause pawns to prefer food placed in dining rooms and foods near spoiling. Certain non-meal foods can be safely eaten without a table.
