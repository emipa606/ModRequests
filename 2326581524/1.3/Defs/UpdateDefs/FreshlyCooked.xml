	<description>Quality Cooking:

If enabled, pawns below a certain cooking skill threshold (simple = 7, fine = 12, lavish = 18) may improperly prepare cooked meals in a variety of ways such as too small portions, too large portions, underseasoned, overcooked, etc..., resulting in a variety of negative effects (mostly mood debuffs). So this feature doesn't impact lavish meals too strongly, there is also an option for a longer-lasting, slowly decreasing, lavish meal thought. 

Freshly Cooked: 

Adds a variety of (optional) food thoughts for eating warm meals, leftover meals, and frozen meals, along with some settings to define how long meals stay warm.
