    Allow pawns to repair weapons and apparel like they do buildings.

    How it works:
    - Speed determined by General Labour Speed and prioritised at the end of Crafting Jobs e.g if a pawn is assigned to crafting and there are no crafting jobs, they will repair items before checking the next category of job.
    - Valid target items are [strike]any apparel or weapon (excluding wooden logs) present in the home region with less than 100% durability[/strike] chosen by you in the Mod Settings menu.
    - Mod Settings page allows for choosing what to repair and when to repair it, see screenshots to find this menu.

    This is my first attempt at a mod so any feedback or issue reports would be appreciated.

    Compatability:
    - No reason it shouldnt work with/without Royalty/Ideology.
    - I believe the jobs appear in the Work Tab mod by Fluffy as "Repair Damaged Weapon" and "Repair Damaged Apparel" under Crafting.
