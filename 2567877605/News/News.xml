		<content>Update 4 of Recycle This mod brings you:
            |-Completely reworked logic behind workgivers. Should give some perfomance improvements on old colonies.
			|-Separation of destroy and recycle work givers. Now you can fine tune priority of those if you have Work Tab from Fluffy.
			|-Improved mod compatibility. Now any modded workbenches (even gas benches from VFE) work with mod.
			|-Recycling of none-smelthable apparel now requires either tailor bench or crafting spot.
			|-Recycling speed now considers work speed factor of workbench.
            |-New work type "Recycle". Vanilla smelting is also moved there.
			|-Switched natural priority of "Art" and "Crafting", because it doesn't make sense in vanilla.
			|-Added new bill "Scrap apparel" for all tailor benches (including modded ones). In case you want to automate your recycling through bills.
			|-Mod options (only contained option to disable apparel scrapping) removed.
