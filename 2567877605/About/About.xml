        Ever got tired of creating bills to smelt and destroy useless junk left from last cannibal raid? Not anymore.
        Just select all items you want to get rid of and pawns will do it.

        This mod allows you to recycle and destroy weapons and apparel through order icons, without creating annoying
        bills. It uses all vanilla values to calculate refund and job speed to make almost identical to vanilla bills
        (Smelt or burn weapons/apparel).
        Basically it adds 2 orders to menu and affected items:

        -Destroy item - selected weapons or apparel will be destroyed on closest campfire or smelter (including modded
        ones).
        -Recycle item - selected weapons or apparel will be either smelted at closest smelter or get scrapped on the
        spot yielding part of it's recipe resources back.

        Post raid cleaning has never been this easy!

        New job (can be seen with Fluffy's Work Tab) assosiated with added features exist in Crafting worktype right
        behind all vanilla jobs.

        Compatibility

        -Should be compatible with any modded smelters and campfires, as long as they have recipe to burn apparel (for
        campfires) and smelt weapons (for smelters).
        -Other mods that add recycle bills are compatible with this mod, as they add completely diffrent things to game.
