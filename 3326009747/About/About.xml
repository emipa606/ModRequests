	<description>Adds a number of tiny vanilla patches and fixes:\n\n
  Wasters don't get as angry about pollution dumping\n
  Drapes muffle sounds (they finally have a real use)\n
  Jealous pawns get upset if they share a lover\n
  Immortal pawns don't demand age reversal\n
  Clothing has no gender restriction\n
  Prisoners can be transferred to another bed\n
  Similar genes are considered the same xenotype, even if they aren't a perfect match\n
  Caravans with nocturnal pawns rest at night instead\n
  Fully covered pawns don't have sunlight sensitivity. Pawns wearing spacer-tier armor don't have the soaking wet moodlet\n
  Highlight steam geysers while placing things that require a geyser like geothermal generators\n
  Pawns with both misandrist and misogynist instead get the "misanthropist" trait\n\n

As well as a few debug actions:\n\n

  Progress all "tend percent diseases" on a pawn (like gut worms which needs total tend quality to exceed 300%)\n
  Half a pawn (remove one of each mirrored organ, and 50% of the brain. This was used for a challenge run I posted on my Youtube channel)\n
  Quarter a pawn (the same, but do 50% damage to each remaining organ)\n\n

And more to come...</description>
