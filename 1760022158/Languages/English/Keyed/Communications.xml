	<Comm_ShipCrashDesc>A space ship was spotted breaking apart in atmosphere. It appears to be general purpose traveler's ship.

Ship plating is often constructed with plasteel and may have left some of the contents intact. You can travel to the crash sites and attempt to salvage what you can, but many others will have also seen the crash and will surely want to claim some of it for themselves.</Comm_ShipCrashDesc>
