  <!--Remove left and right ear body addons. Rendering of these parts is handled by RatkinHeadDrawer class instead because BodyAddons are not aware of direction that the head is facing. -->
  <!--BodyAddons follow the direcition of body instead. This becomes problematic when the head and body are facing different directions due to a feature added by Facial Stuff mod. -->
