Overrides the core textures. 
Some buildings have new size, didn't forget about it when you plan your base. 

There is not full pack, I will update it when I draw new items. 

Check Reskin collection, there are some of my other mods with overridng textures.

If you have problem with other mods try to place this mod upper than others.

Support me on patreon, it will motivate me to continue: https://www.patreon.com/cattleya . I public here some sketches, ideas, thoughts and anounces. Also be free to write me, maybe will draw some things for you for Rimworld!
