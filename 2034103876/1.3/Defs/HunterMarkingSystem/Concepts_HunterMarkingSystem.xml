    <helpText>Some Hunters will be Unblooded. Which is to say they haven't got a worthy kill yet and have a permanent mood penalty because of it.\n\nIn order to get rid of this penalty, the Yautja needs to have the killing blow on a worthy prey (big predators, other pawns) and mark themselves with it.</helpText>

    <helpText>When a Hunter kills worthy prey, they will have the option to mark themself with the blood of the kill.\n\nFind the creature the pawn killed in its health tab. Then right-click the creature and choose the option to mark yourself with it. Once done, the Yautja will get a permanent boost to mood.\n\n As the Yautja kill stronger games, they will be able to mark themsleves again and get a better permanent mood bonus.\n\n If the creature the Yautja killed is accidently destroyed before they can amrk themself, you can use the blood of a similar prey to mark the Yautja.</helpText>
