    <label>Armour - Acid</label>
    <description>The chance to affect Acid-related damage like burns.\n\nUpon taking damage, first this armour rating is reduced by the attack's armour penetration value. The remaining armour rating is then compared against a random number from 0 to 100.\n\n    -If the random number is under half the armour rating, the damage deflects harmlessly.\n    -If the random number is over half the armour rating, but not higher than the armour rating, the damage is mitigated. This means it is reduced by half.\n    -If the random number is greater than the armour rating, the armour has no effect.\n\nFor example, at 90% armour rating against an attack with 10% armour penetration, there is a 40% chance of deflecting the attack harmlessly, and a 40% chance of mitigating the damage.\n\nIn the case of apparel armour, each layer of apparel applies its armour to the attack separately, from the outside in.</description>
