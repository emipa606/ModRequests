    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] joined the corporate branch of Weyland-Yutani, which is involved in many of the momentous decisions behind the money-making initiatives of the company.\n\nUnfortunately, poor first impressions lead to [PAWN_nameDef] being assigned as a liaison for a frontier mercenary group under Weyland-Yutani's payroll. Being confined to a cramped corporate office with a group of soldiers who cared for little beyond their pay lead to [PAWN_nameDef] being ignored at best, and openly disparaged at worst. The military environment rubbed off on [PAWN_objective], either as a minimal sign of camaraderie, or due to a need for [PAWN_nameDef] to defend [PAWN_objective]self from the mercenaries themselves. </baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] lived out on a outer rim colony before a ship burst through the atmosphere and crashed near the colony grounds.

But the nightmares make it hard to focus.\n\nPTSD the doc called it.</baseDesc>
