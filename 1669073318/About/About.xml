    Adds the Gors, Ungors and the Bullgors of the Beastmen.
    This mod require Alien Framework.
    Load Humanoid Alien Races before this mod.

    The beastmen herd arrives at Rimworld. The big violent gors comes to raid your base. Favouring close combat they charge you while their lesser kind; the ungors joins the fray.
    Protect your weaklings with bulky gors that can be sustained by eating the corpses of your enemies. Let the ungors perfrom the menial tasks and feed them with whatever is left.
    Now the even deadlier bullgors joins the herd. Larger than the gors they spread devastation across the battlefields.

    New races: gor, ungor and bullgor
    New faction: Cloven ones
    New sculptures: runestones
    New apparel: furmantle, loincloth, shaman robe, chainmail / helmet, bullgor plate.
    New weapons: 5 melee weapons wielded by the gors

    Gor: Tough and strong fighters, but slow builders and horrible researchers.
    Ungor: A bit stronger than the human conterparts but a tad slower in working speed.
    Bullgor: Large and deadly gors, they have a limited apparel selection but are natural tough. They tend to be gluttenous and prefer raw meat. Can't research.

    Feel free to leave a message about tweaks or any general input.
