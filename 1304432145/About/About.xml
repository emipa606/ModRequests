	<description>Adds 3 buildings to revive registered dead colonists.

Meat Grinder
	- Will grind meat or corpses for amino acids
	~250 amino acids capacity
	- Supplies ressources to Clone Vat.

Pheno Drill
	- Performs venipuncture to initiate Colonist register.
	- Transmits data to Clone Vat if in range.
	- Registers up to 4 colonists.
	- The registered pawn must have at least one non artificial arm or leg. When you cant find the vein ...

Clone Vat
	- Revives a dead colonist with a 3 level penalty in each skill.
	- Clones spawn naked.
	- Bionics are replaced with missing parts. That can be lethal.


Bench quality affects their statistics
	- Meat grinder quality makes its capacity go from 150 to 350.
	- Pheno drill quality lowers the XP loss up to -1. You still loose xp.
	- Clone vat quality highers the chances to forget a missing body part aka regrow it.
	- Clone vat quality lowers the work amount, meaning faster clone spawn.

Clone vat chances to forget (calculated for each bionic body part):
	- awful 1/512
	- Shoddy 1/256
	- Poor 1/128
	- Normal 1/64
	- Good 1/32
	- Superior 1/16
	- Excellent 1/8
	- Masterwork 1/4
	- legendary 1/2
