		This is a simple xpath patch library with simple settings that allows you to choose what metal/wood/stone your clothing or armor is made of.
		
		All patches are loaded at start up that's and why settings need to be restarted.

		Compatibility:
		- This mod is compatible with saved games.

		- This mod is not recommended to be removed from saves.
		- This mod is not compatible with other mods that significantly change the vanilla armor like CE.
		
		- Multiplayer is untested but since this runs everything at start up and to remain in sync I recommend making it a manditory mod.

		- Current Patches Available:
			- Vanilla Armours Expanded (VAE must be loaded before this mod)
			- Flak Armors: SpecOps Edition
			- Contractor's Arsenal 
			- Risk of Rain: UES Contact Light Armory
			- Altered Carbon's Protectorate Armor
			- Glass+Lights
			- Expanded Materials - Plastics
			- Rimworld: Spartan Foundry (Continued) (Makes All Armors craftable/stuffable)
			- A Mod About Meat (enable in settings)
			- Blood and Bones (enable in settings)
			- Science Never Stops: Ambition of the Cosmic
			- Orassans
			- [RH2] Rimmu-Nation² - Clothing
			- Ancient Fallout Armory
			- Vanilla Apparel Expanded
			- Rimsenal - Core
			- Rimsenal - Augmented Vanilla Pack
			- Royal Arsenal
			- Rim-Effect: Core
			- Rim-Effect: N7
			- Rim-Effect: Asari and Reapers
			
		Shouldn't cause issues unless changes made to these armors by other mods.
		
		Any issue please drop a note on the mod page :)
		
		If you are looking for your clothing to have ART?! check it out under my steam page.
		
		Happy Stuffing
