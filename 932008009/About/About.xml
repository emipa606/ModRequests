  <description>1.5.0.0 (04-08-2024)

Adds modding components to RimWorld: vehicles, spell casting, weapon slots, oversized weapons, and more!

Note to players: This mod will not change your game, but rather it lets modders do more, so you can have an even more amazing RimWorld experience.

Note to modders: This mod is filled with lots of tools that allow you to do many new and different things in RimWorld. Check out RoxxPloxx's guide for more info here: https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki

Partial list of components:

CompAbilityUser
 - Adds spell/ability casting to humanlikes.

CompActivatableEffect
 - Adds an activation graphic for weapons (e.g. lightsaber beam).

CompDeflector
 - Allows the ability to knock projectiles to melee weapons.

CompExtraSounds
 - Allows extra melee sounds to weapons.

CompLumbering
 - Makes a staggered walking animation. (e.g. ATST walking effect)

CompOversizedWeapon
 - Allows weapons with graphic sizes that can be bigger than RimWorld's limits.

CompSlotLoadable
 - Adds slots to objects that can be filled to have effects. (e.g. different ammo types for guns, crystals for lightsabers)

CompToggleDef (by Roxxploxx)
- Allows for something to despawn, change its def, and respawn.

CompVehicle (experimental for 1.0, removed for 1.1+)
 - Allows for a pawn to be treated as a vehicle that can be loaded with pilots, gunners, crew, and passengers.

CompInstalledPart (WIP)
- Allows installation and uninstallation of things onto other things. This is particularly useful for weapons on vehicles.
