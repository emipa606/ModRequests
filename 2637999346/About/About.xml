    <description>This mod will enable you to :
- Rename the AI factions and leaders.
- Modify or load in new ideology
- Change faction relationships
- Change faction colour
- Change the names of settlements
- Relocate settlements (only works when starting a new game)

Please note that this is my first mod for this game (or any game really). So it's quite likely a bit rough and I'm not sure if it'll work for any other language than English.

If you'd like to further customize your factions (change their apperance, loadout, and more) I'd recommend this mod:

Total Control

Update: I'm unsure of the consequences of changing faction ideology or their relationships. So use with care and not for a game you're serious with, at least not until this has been tested enough.
