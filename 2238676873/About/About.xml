  <description>Ever wonder why stone chunks needed to be cut into blocks before being sculpted into statues? I did, and then I decided that was silly, and made a mod to stop it. This mod adds an option to craft statues out of stone chunks. The work amount is the same as normal sculptures.

Every small, large and grand statue takes 1, 2 and 8 chunks, respectively. 

A separate recipe has to be used to craft with chunks. Sculptures crafted from chunks are called statues.</description>
