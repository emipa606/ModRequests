Contains multi-talented robots to serve your colony. It also adds a research tab, materials, and a new Robotics workbench for crafting the *Misc. Robots* and Robots++ objects.

R++ was made using the "Misc. Robots Xtension" provided by Haplo. Big shout-out to Haplo for the awesome misc mods, eh!

### **Robots++ Contains The Following Bots**
*These bots combine multiple abilities to perform common colony tasks*
- **Kitchen Robot**
	
    A unit capable of cooking, as well as sowing and cutting plants.
    A useful robot both in the kitchen, and on the farm.

- **Crafter Bot**

	A unit capable of smithing, tailoring, and crafting.
	The perfect slaves for an automated assembly line!

- **Builder Bot**

	A Builder unit capable of constructing, deconstructing, repairing, and mining. 
	It will also cut plants that are in the way, but may not be used for farming.
	
- **ER Bot**

	An Emergency Response unit capable of treating patients and fighting fires. 
	Don't be scared of the needle; it wont hurt (much).

- **Omni Bot**

	The OmniBot is at the end of the techtree
	and requires you to research all of the other robots first.
	The OmniBot can do the jobs of all the other robots.


R++ also changes the Hauling and Cleaning  *Misc. Robots*.

### Craftable
*You can makey the thingies now!* Research the tech! Make the components! Build the thingies!


### Multiple Tiers of Robots and Research

*Each Tier is over-all better than the last!*

There are five tiers of robots:
```
  Tier 1 Simple robots have level 4 skills,
  Tier 2 Basic robots have level 8 skills,
  Tier 3 Intermediate robots have level 13 skills,
  Tier 4 Advanced robots have level 16 skills,
  Tier 5 Anti-Logic robots have level 20 skills.
```


Each tier has a faster movement speed and more fire resistance than the previous.
Hauling and Cleaning type robots are much faster than any other robot in the same tier.
Higher tiers also recharge at faster rates!

### F.A.Q.
```

A:No

Q:How To Repair Robots
A:select a pawn with a high enough construction and right click the disabled bot
```

### Localization / Translation

User-made translations are included. If you would like to translate for R++ please use the `/Languages/English/` folder as a template. When you've finished; please notify me and I'll include it in the mod.


### Load Order
R++ requires *Misc. Robots*. Keep them close together and near the top. It's advised to only keep large collections of mods, like the Misc. Mods, close together near the top. Single-file mods and other mods should be loaded after them (not a rule set in stone, but it can fix a lot of headaches).

Example Mod Load Order:
1. Core
2. Libraries (like Hugslib)
3. Misc Robots
4. Misc Robots++
5. Other mods (like Science Never Stops)
