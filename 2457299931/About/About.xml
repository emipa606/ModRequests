  <description>Dried Berries and Meats
  
Version 1.0

Adds a drying rack and the drying of meats and berries at any tech level.

This is simply putting things on a drying rack and letting the air dry them.
Earth has been doing it for eons. I think the RIM can too.

Dried meats (25 days) and berries (50 days) last less time than vanilla pemmican (70 days), but are great preserved foods nonetheless.
Refridgerate them and they last even longer.
Single and bulk recipes included.
