	<description>A mod from RimDungeon Series focusing on adding more traps. Whilst the content of the mod expands rapidly, at current time following are included:
- Animal Traps: Noose traps to immobilise animals or Bear traps to kill them.

- Caltrops: Painful to step on, take a very long time to walk through.

- Spikes: A normal spike trap has been buffed and is now rearmable. There is also an improved version which does massive damage but costs way more resources.

- Faulty Columns: For when you really want to drop mountain on top of raiders.

- Poisons: Different variaties, ranging from Rage to Neurotoxin.

- Gases: Similar variety to poisons, with few extra such as Wall Gas to block passages in an emergency.
