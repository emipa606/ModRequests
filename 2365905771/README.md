### Bear Trap
Whilst usually used against bears, this trap can be effectively used against a variety of animals, or even humans. It does a decent amount of piercing damage, and gives a long-term movement penalty but requires metal to make.

## Noose Trap
A noose trap. Whilst damage might be enough to kill small animals, its main benefit is ability to immobilise target for a long time in a noose. Humans are unlikely to trigger it.
