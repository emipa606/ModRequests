  <description>Tribal babies need cribs too!

These cribs aren't research restricted, don't require cloth, and the fur blanket can be painted with the new paintable system in Biotech. The turned down flap of the blanket has "Colonist Bed" color and can be changed to "Medical Bed" color, while preserving your custom paint job.

This mod was designed to match the art style of the Medieval Overhaul mod. Medieval Overhaul furniture can be seen in a preview image on the Steam Workshop.
