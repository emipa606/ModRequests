Removes the (arbitrary) limit to the number of areas you can create, change area colours.

![Notes](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Notes.png)  
While this completely removes the limit on the number of areas you can create, the area selection widget in other parts of the UI is untouched - and designed for 5 areas per type. If you create too many areas, you may run into issues. This practical limit depends largely on your resolution and UI size factor. I have no plans to update these UI issues, nor could I do so for all the mods that use areas.

Normally, this is where I ask you to show you appreciation by buying me a coffee.

These are not normal times. Ukraine is being invaded by Russia, at the whim of a ruthless dictator. Innocent people are loosing their lives, and fighting for their continued freedom.

This is not a matter of politics. This is not a debate. Putins' bloody campaign in Ukraine is illegal, and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants, when he wants it, no matter the cost. The Russian army is invading a country without provocation, bombing civilians and murdering innocents.

The prospect of waking up to see my country at war is alien to me, as it must have seemed to most Ukrainians. I can do little to influence the outcome of current affairs, but I will do whatever I can.

**I ask you to join me in supporting the people of Ukraine**

![How can you help?](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/How%20can%20you%20help%3F.png)  
If you can, donate to the various charities providing humanitarian aid. 

You can also help out in other ways, from reaching out to your elected representatives to helping fact-check social media. 

If you don't know where to donate, or how to start helping, Global Citizen maintains a list of charitable organizations active in the region and other ways in which you can help.
