本模组修复了Area Unlocker在环世界1.5中无法排序区域的问题，原模组作者为Fluffy。

This mod fixed the issue that Area Unlocker can't reorder areas in RimWorld 1.5, the original mod author is Fluffy.

因为原模组本身就是一个Harmony补丁，发一个补丁的修复补丁很别扭，所以在此上传一个新的分支。此分支已经提交至github pull request，待原作者合并后会隐藏此分支模组。

Because the original mod itself is a Harmony patch, it's awkward to send a patch to fix a patch, so I uploaded a new branch here. This branch has been submitted to the github pull request, and this branch mod will be hidden after the original author merges it.

以下是原模组的描述：

Below is the original mod description:

------

Removes the (arbitrary) limit to the number of areas you can create, change area colours.

&lt;size=28&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;

While this completely removes the limit on the number of areas you can create, the area selection widget in other parts of the UI is untouched - and designed for 5 areas per type. If you create too many areas, you may run into issues. This practical limit depends largely on your resolution and UI size factor. I have no plans to update these UI issues, nor could I do so for all the mods that use areas.

&lt;size=28&gt;Known Issues&lt;/size&gt;

- reordering areas is currently broken (2024-03-15, 1.5)

&lt;size=28&gt;Powered by Harmony&lt;/size&gt;
