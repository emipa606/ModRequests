  <!--
    Patterns are defined in a PatternDef and are made up of segments.

    Segment selection: segments will be grouped together if they share a tag prefixed with `meme_`.
    If possible, we will first select segments from groups that have not been used yet. Otherwise
    we will select any other segment (from the other groups and ungrouped segments).

    In effect, using a `meme_` prefixed tag on segments ensures they will be used before we fall back to generic segments.

    Use `(uses=1)` on a segments used multiple times (like episodes) to ensure the same segment is not used twice in the one pattern.
