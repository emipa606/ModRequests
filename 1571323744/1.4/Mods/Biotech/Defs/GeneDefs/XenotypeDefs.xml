    <description>Biolithics are those with traits related to the xenohuman race known as Crystalloids. Their bodies are semi-lithic, with small yet varying amounts of crystalline material present in their bodies, especially concentrated within their hair, giving them their singature blue/purple hued hair. They are psychically blessed with an attunement to psychic connections through specialized organomineralized crystal. \n\nScholars aren't sure whether Crystalloids or Biolithics came first. The earliest documentation about Biolithic genes came from several millenia old reports originating from a research world called Arethusa, known for its unique geothermal vents. However the fate of the world and the mystery of the origin of Crystalloids remains lost within the Mechanoid Exclusion Zone.</description>
