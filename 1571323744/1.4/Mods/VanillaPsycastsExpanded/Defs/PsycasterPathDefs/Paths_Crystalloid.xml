        <tooltip>The occult ekrispath is poorly understood; but it is known that it stands in opposition against Archotechnology, instead tapping into mysterious powers originating deep within the psychic ether to disrupt the fabric of reality as they see fit. The immense power of the Ekrispath requires nearly impossible talent to cast, leaving even talented Empire psycasters out of its grasp of understanding. Ekrispathists border on the cusp of eldritch divinity, augmenting themselves beyond simple mortals as they claim reaching "Transendence".</tooltip>
