	<description>This mod changes how the infestation event works.

Instead of producing additional hives over time, hives will now periodically send out aggressive manhunter insects. If there are more hives, expect to see manhunter insects more frequently. Manhunter insects will attack living beings and attempt to haul them back to their hive. Deal with the hives quickly to avoid having these manhunter insects invade your colony.</description>
