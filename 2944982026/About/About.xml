<description>&lt;size=20&gt;Features:&lt;/size&gt;

Adds 40+ hairstyles that include some kind of head accessory, such as a headband, a face mask or even a balaclava. Now your pawns can have unique appearances that match their backstories or expand on their lore!
The accessories benefit from another mod in your mod list that allows hair alpha masks, such as Humanoid Alien Races, HairPlusPlus or Hair Modding Plus. This will ensure that the accessories retain their colour. 
I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I did making it! For more mods, check out my Steam Workshop, or for lite versions of my HD mods, visit my Ko-Fi: @Rooboid.
