	Light Mortar adds a new item... well you guess it... Light Mortar
	
	Light Mortar is a smaller, lighter, weaker version of the mortar. A single Pawn can carry a mortar with some ammunition to a raid, trading fire power for weight. The ammunition also weight less. Oh! also because of the smaller load, the barrel will NEVER break! (i might change this and apply some sort of new material like the reinforced barrel in 1,3 update)

	Light Mortar:
	HP	: 100
	mass	: 12 kg (i copied the weight of RM-38 Soviet light mortar)
	material	: 100 steel and 4 component (i might balance this later)
	range	: min 30 tiles, max 100 tiles (might change this,
		  but im pretty fine with it now)
	
	Small HE Shell:
	mass	: 0.5 kg
	material	: 5 steel and and 5 fuel + lvl 4 crafting (i might also balance this later) 
	explosion	: 3x3 BOOM! (it's smaller, but the accuracy will compensate for this)
	
	todo:
	- improve the model of the Light Mortar
	- remove the annoying idle mortar animation (that make the top swing left to right.
	  Someone help me with this pls, google has forsaken me)
	- add some more ammo (prolly just smoke shell and incendiary)
	- balance the material cost and power (pls give me suggestions)
	
	extra note:
	
	This is my first mod. So far i haven't find any bug (since i also haven't test it a lot lol), if you find some please tell me and i'll try to repair it. If i don't! then i don't deserve to graduate from campus, im taking computer science(it's a pain).
