		    \n\nTo your majesty.
			\nThe reports were right
            \nthe daer ate our soldiers
            \nour best and brighest don't know what
            \ncould have made these animals so agressive.

            \n\nI decided to find out myself.
            \nTracked the Daer to it's cave
            \nFascinating creatures.

            \n\nI saw it drag down a soldier, not ours.
            \nThe behavior of the animal was strange
            \nit didn't eat the soldier
            \nit played with it.. tortured it.
			
            \nHe is still alive
            \nI will save him, and find out
			\nwhat makes them so agressive.</description>

		    \n\nWhen I was a kid
			\nI saw the most majestic creature
            \nfly high above the clouds
            \nI chased after it
            \nfell and broke my ankle.

            \n\nIt snooped down.
            \nLooked me in the eyes
            \nand carried me back to the city.

            \n\nI saw it again today.
            \nIt killed people
            \njust a farmer and his kid
            \nI don't know what changed.
			
            \nI will find it
            \nit must remember me, right?
			\nmaybe I can calm it down.</description>

			\nYour dear majesty
            \nwe are progressing, even though somewhat slowly
            \nThe Witch requires more silver for the materials
            \nbut the first steps are done, she talked to them.

            \n\nThe Unholds are.. scaring me.
            \nthey could break me with a single swipe of their arm
            \nHow is she not scared? How can she just.. talk with them?

            \n\nI suggest you approve her request for silver.
            \nI know I am but a servant, and it's a lot of silver
            \nbut this could win us the war!
            \nthis could make you an empress even.</description>

            \n\I believe the texts are right.
            \nThe Witch isn't a person
            \nits more so a force of nature.

            \n\nHowever, this force of nature has feelings.
            \nAnd it has children
            \nIf the legends are right.. I'm standing right before a child of hers.

            \n\nIf we could only capture it..
            \nWe could bargain with her
            \nWe could save our lands.
            \nI will try to find out more about it.</description>
