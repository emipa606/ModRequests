	Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids | Patched all charging stations into a single dropdown menu.
	Vanilla Furniture Expanded | Patched all sun and standing / modern lamps into their respective dropdown menus.
	
(Patched Dropdowns spreadsheet file was updated accordingly, if you want to see the details.)

	Brain In A Jar | Patched all brain jars into a single dropdown menu.
	[JDS] Simple Storage | Patched in 8 new dropdown menus.

(Patched Dropdowns spreadsheet file was updated accordingly, if you want to see the details.)

Version 2.2.1

- Fixed Gas Traps and Shells DD patch appliying and causing errors for people that don't have the mod installed.
- Removed the patch for interaction and sleeping spots, as too many people are having problems with it.
(Works fine for me, though. If it worked fine for you as well or you wish to test out the patch, check the Testing Required folder.)

Version 2.2.0

- Added Dropdown Menus for:
	All IEDs / Mines and Vents from Gas Traps and Shells Mod (Transferred from my GTaS Retexture)

- Fixed the [SYR] Universal Fermenter not being shifted into the right category.
- Shifted the vanilla Tool Cabinet into the Cabinets (Linkables) DD Menu.
- Shifted newly introduced batteries from Alpha Animals mod into the Batteries DD Menu.
- Added a spreadsheet file in the About folder that shows every patched-in dropdown menu and all of their items / buildables.
(It's a Libre Office spreadsheet, but you should be able to open it with Microsoft Office Excell or other programs.)

Version 2.1.1

- Marked DocWorld as incompatible for now, thanks to Dr Zhivago. It's not a major conflict, since my mod seems to mess up a couple of Docworld's dropdown menu layouts.
Further compatibility will be addressed and added after the next major DocWorld update.

Version 2.1.0

- Added Dropdown Menus for:

	All Vanilla Interaction Spots
	All Vanilla and Modded IED Traps / Mines (Transferred from my Vanilla Security Retexture)
	All Vanilla and Modded Fermenting Barrels / Distilleries.
(Transferred from my Fermenting Barrels Dropdown Menus)
	
- Shifted vanilla Crafting and Butcher spot into the Misc architect tab to merge with other spots.
- Added support for [SYR] Universal Fermenter > Fermenting Barrel
(This mod removes the Wine and Mead barrels and makes the Vanilla Barrel stuffable, 
so it won't be merged into any of the dropdown menus, therefore this is just a patch for future-proofing reasons.)

Version 2.0.0

- Initial Release.
	
Compatibility:

Combat Extended and Multiplayer compatible, if the original mods support them.
