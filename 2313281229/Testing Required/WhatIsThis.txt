BROKEN? | DDPatchInteractionSpotsVanilla.xml | This is a patch that shifts all vanilla interaction and sleeping spots into their own designated dropdown menus.
While it works completely fine for me, for some unknown reason, quite a number of people are having problems with this patch.

- If it worked fine for you so far or you wish to test it out, go right ahead. Simply copy this patch from here and paste it into the Patches/Zen folder, where all other DDPatch files are.
- If you encounter any errors, please leave a report in the designated discussion thread on the mod's Steam page, found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2313281229
- Please describe the problem and take a screenshot or provide the devmode logs if any red errors pop up, as well.

WORK IN PROGRESS! | DDPatchSimpleStorageOptional.xml | Contains designated dropdown menus for most wooden crates and pallets with boxes from the Simple Storage mod.
This patch can only be used by replacing the original SimplyCrate.xml and SimplyCrate2.xml from [JDS] Simple Storage with the modified versions found in this folder.

- <stuffCategories> is the culprit, it makes those items buildable out of any woody material, which automatically results in nested dropdown menus; which the vanilla game UI cannot handle.
- I've removed / replaced <stuffCategories> with the modified files. By doing this, you'll get errors on wooden crates and pallets that are already built. Deconstructing them fixes the errors.
- Known issues: Removes option to build stuff out of AA's Red Wood and all wood types from Expanded Woodworking. Affected items will be white because of the base textures, a retexture is required.
