	The Rim is a dangerous place, and mankind has been adapting to harsh environs for millenia before they took to
	the stars.Husbandry was often a method used to make agriculture easier, but mankind does what it does best, turning
	peaceful intentions into weapons of war.The people of the Rim are no different, and have over time bred animals for killing, hunting
	and hauling loads.The difference being is that humanity has had more time to perfect the process, and create technologies like
	genetic engineering to make it easier.
