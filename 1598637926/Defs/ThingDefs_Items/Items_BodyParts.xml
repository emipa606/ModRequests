		<label>archotech rebreather lung</label>
		<description>An artifical lung built by an archotech. It supplies the body with oxygen on its own and filters carbon dioxide out of the blood. It also supports the body with releasing other other useful substances to the body when needed to enhance it. With this lung the wearer never runs out of breath. They can dive for hours without breathing or inhale polluted or toxic air without any harm to the body. Its internal workings are a mystery to all human minds.</description>
