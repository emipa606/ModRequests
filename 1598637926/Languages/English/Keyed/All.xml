	<Terra_SettingsClimatePlantSpawnerDescription>Use the climate wild plant spawner instead of the core one. This means that wild plants on a map are based on the map climate and not the biome. This results in maps having a unique vegetation and smoother transitions between biome vegetation types. Note that changing this mid game / for existing saves can result in weird behaviour.</Terra_SettingsClimatePlantSpawnerDescription>

	<Terra_SettingsDynamicTerrainDescription>This enables all kinds of dynamic terrain that this mod provides. Weather affects terrain, plants consume ground fertility and moisture, rivers can flood and dry out, coasts have tides, ... Note that changing this mid game / for existing saves can result in weird behaviour.</Terra_SettingsDynamicTerrainDescription>-->
