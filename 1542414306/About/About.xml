	<description>A nice happy race of people-foxes. Alien Race Framework required, load after it. Built-in support for EPOE.

	Plenty of things planned in the versions to come, this is the first public release so don't expect too much.

	Relationships incompatible with Psychology - not my fault, can't fix on my end.

	Adds Faction, starting Scenario, playable Race, Throne, Quarterstaff and Bycocket (Robin Hood Hats).

	Plenty of backstories, as well as names. Suggestions? Find @MikeRobe on the Rimworld Discord.
