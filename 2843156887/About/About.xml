	<description>This mod changes how much Sight and light levels affect most pawn stats:

Darkness = Light levels lower than 30%.	

- Move Speed: Pawns with less than 50% Sight will move up to 40% slower than pawns with more than 50% Sight.
- Move Speed: Non-blind pawns in Darkness will move up to 50% slower instead of just 20% slower.
- Eating Speed: Pawns with less than 50% Sight will eat up to 40% slower than pawns with more than 50% Sight.
- Eating Speed: Non-blind pawns in Darkness will eat up to 50% slower.
- Global Work Speed: Non-blind pawns in Darkness will do all work up to 80% slower instead of just 20% slower.
- Medical Tend Speed/Quality/Operation Speed/Success Chance: Same as above (light levels had no effect previously).
- The Importance of Sight has been increased to 70% for the following stats:
* Global Work Speed
* Medical Tend Speed
* Medical Tend Quality
* Medical Operation Speed
* Medical Surgery Success Chance



Note: The Sight-related debuffs will only apply to pawns with less than 50% Sight. This means that just missing one eye won't make much of a difference, but having badly damaged or no vision on both eyes will considerably affect everything they do.
Note2: With the exception of Medical Tend Speed/Quality, having more than 100% Sight does not increase these stats further than their base value.
Note3: Global Work Speed has no effect on any Medical stats, as it is in vanilla.
Note4: Pawns that "prefer darkness" will not be affected by the Darkness debuffs.
Note5: If a pawn has less than 50% Sight and is in total Darkness, they will move significantly slower than everyone else, including completely blind pawns.
