This mod adds 3 traits, a different reaction to the bite dependant on the relationship between the pawns, and an auto-feed option.

The traits:
- Sanguophile: loves to be fed on, bonus opinion on sanguophages.
- Sanguofriend: doesn't mind being fed on, gets a tiny mood bonus for helping their friend out.
- Sanguophobe: hates sanguophages, will have an opinion debuff on them.

When pawns have an opinion of 85 or more towards the sanguophage, or they're in any kind of (vanilla) love relationship, they'll have a positive reaction to the bite.

There are settings for almost every value, including a toggle per-pawn for auto-feed. Auto-feed will only happen with pawns that won't get upset about it.
 
Felt weird that everyone absolutely hated being bitten regardless of their relationship with the sanguophage, it bothered me so much that I learnt how to mod just to make this.
	
Let me know if you find any issues with it and I'll try my best to fix it if it's within my ability.
