	[h1]DESCRIPTION[/h1]
	This is a HIRES Graphic replacement for MANY items in RimWorld.  This mod is a work-in-progress, so some items are still lores (and it doesn't replace EVERYTHING ... yet). 
	
	This mod MAINLY focuses on dropped items, sowed crops, and many trade goods, but there are also some workbenches and furniture.  For trees and crops, I recommend "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431123295]Flora Reskin[/url]" (created by cattleya) and my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435443549]Flora Reskin Addon[/url].

	Some textures/reskins include:
	[list]
        [*] Meals, Food, Sowed Crops (HIRES)
        [*] Steel, Plasteel, Gold, Silver, Jade (HIRES)
	[*] Cloth, Leather and Devilstrand (HIRES)
	[*] Drugs and Medicine (HIRES)
	[*] Workbenches [i.e. butcher table] (LORES at this time)
	[*] Sculptures (LORES at this time)
	[*] User Interface buttons
	[*] Some Furniture (but I recommend the "GloomyFurniture" mod)
	[*] Nutrient Dispenser, Geothermal Reactor, Solar Power, Battery (LORES at this time)
	[*] Texture replacements for other mod items, including: 
             [list]

[*] And various others...

	[h1]RECOMMENDED MODS[/h1]
	I have also created the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435443549]Flora Reskin Addon[/url] mod (which requires the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431123295]Flora Reskin[/url] mod, created by cattleya). Flora Reskin changes all of the base trees and crops in the game, and looks fantastic. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435443549]Flora Reskin Addon[/url] changes many of the trees and crops that are added and used in other mods.
	
	
	[h1]INSTALLATION AND LOAD ORDER[/h1]
	Installtion Instruction: Just install the mod. If you are using any of the other mods , then load this mod AFTER all of those other mods (place it at the end of the list). 
	
	If you are using OTHER TEXTURE MODS, and like THEIR textures more... then load these other mods AFTER this mod (if their mod is loaded AFTER this one, then their changes will overwrite these texture!). For example, I like "GloomyFurniture" more than some of my workbench textures, and "Floral Reskin" is amazing. So, I place those mods AFTER this mod. The load order that I use is:

	[list]
        [*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007061826]VGP Vegetable Garden[/url]	
	[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007062688]VGP Garden Dyes[/url]
	[*] Jabbamonkey's HIRES Graphic Overhaul
	[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431123295]Flora Reskin[/url]
	[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1558635181]GloomyFurniture[/url]
	[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1883678698]Gloomy Vanilla Overhaul[/url]

	If you find any problems, post it in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2460633890/5350815203292336955/]BUGS and LOGS[/url] discussion (in the discussion tab above). Or post it in the comments below (but this isn't ideal because it's meant for quick comments and not a back-and-forth discussion)
