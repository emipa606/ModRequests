  <description>This is a simple mod that allows you to choose what metal a suit of marine (power) armor is made of, and scales the armor's attributes to that of the material.
Vanilla marine armor is made with plasteel, so I tried to balance this mod against that. The results are that this mod makes plasteel marine armor a little more powerful, but you're not unstoppable. However, it also allows you to make marine armor out of any metal you want, including those introduced by mods.

Compatibility:
- This mod is NOT compatible with saved games that you've already built marine armor in.
- This mod is NOT compatible with other mods that change the vanilla power armor.
- - Exception: This mod has been patched to be compatible with Vanilla Armour Expanded.
- This mod is compatible with all other mods.</description>
