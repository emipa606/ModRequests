        <v1.1>adds quotes from /r/ShitRimWorldSays to RimWorld loading screens

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Important&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
If you’re easily offended, please do not install this mod.

/r/ShitRimworldSays is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;taken out of context&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Features&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from /r/ShitRimworldSays, and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

For example;

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Known Issues&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Version&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
This is version 2.2.25, for RimWorld 1.1.2654.
