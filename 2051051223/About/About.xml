  Version 1.3
  
  Archo World Geneticist Ricky VonSpankerDoodle brings us his latest creation, Boomaphants. Created for one thing only, producing chemfuel for harsh Rim Worlds. Tame like Elephants and with both genders having tusks this mix between an Elephant and a Boomalope produces almost three times the chemfuel as a boomalope. Unaware hunters have met their maker trying to feed the masses, so beware. Seasoned hunters know to let the rain depict hunting times and to finish off from afar as their explosions are huge.
  
  Safe to add mid game, just remmeber to update your corpse stockpile.
  
  Resurrected this idea from B18. All reworked from scratch.
