RunAndGun has been updated to support Rimworld version 1.1 (including the expansion). Credits for this update go to Ogliss. Thanks to this amazing community my mods are being kept alive! This version also supports Rimworld 1.0, so no need to worry if you're still using that version.

RunAndGun has been updated to support Rimworld version 1.3.
All credits of this update go to &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ogliss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;, who did a great job updating this. 

As you might know I'm not really active as modder anymore, but I do intend to keep all my mods alive. The reason I'm no longer active is because I'm working on my own game: &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cursed Crew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. If you like my work, be sure to check it out! You can find a link to Cursed Crew the mod page of every mod I created. 

Enjoy the update!

Cheers,
Roolo
