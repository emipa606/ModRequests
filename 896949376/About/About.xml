  <description>Pygmy muffalos: a smaller species of muffalo, bred for their hardiness in less-vegetative environments. Pygmy muffalos eat less than their larger cousins, and provide milk and wool in smaller quantities but more frequently.

  A17 changes:
  * looks like the muffalo itself changed; I adjusted the pygmy's milk/wool output to maintain equivalent long-term output with the muffalo's, and the baseHungerRate to make sure they eat less. (Not sure if I missed this tag the first time around or if it's a new one. If I missed it, the A17 mod won't break if played with A16. If it's new, I dunno if it'll be game-breaking, but at the very least it'll spawn an error message.)
  * Pygmy muffalos now use muffalo meat and leather, instead of generating their own special pygmy products.
  
  ATTN Steam users: I will be updating THIS HERE for new alphas, not creating a new mod for a new version. When A17 hits, and I update accordingly, Steam will automatically update your copy of the mod to A17 whether you like it or not; this may break your game if you've set your Rimworld version to stay A16. See https://github.com/Tammabanana/Pygmy-Muffalos/releases for earlier-alpha versions, and http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Installing_mods#Installation for where to put the unzipped mod folder.</description>
