		Adds a new sowable plant after researching Tree sowing that acts as a way to renewably produce fine meals, kibble, and Survival meals for colonies that cannot hunt for meat, or are too lazy to do so.

		Basically the Mealwood plant from "Oxygen not included" as a fairly balanced "growable meat" mod, for those that like Oxygen not included, or just want a more balanced go at "this plant counts as meat now".
		Balance wise it puts out 16 insect meat every 8.5 days, even in bad soil, but requires the Tree sowing Research, so its a good way for tribals to make pemmican since they start with tree sowing.

		Since most colonists dislike Insect meat, this mod goes well with "Entomophagy" (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407672870) so you can have cooks make seperate insect meat and real meat meals,
		and vice versa have a way to supply your Entomophages with insect meat.
