	<description>Adds a Prestige Psychic Harmonizer that is much more powerful and covers an entire map. Also improves psychic sensitivity.

Perfect for use by eccentric royals or oppressive tyrants that want to make sure their servants don't betray them. Not so good for said servants.
Due to their improved design, users of this device are still affected by other Psychic Harmonizers, prestige or not. 
As such, combining normal and prestige harmonizers can be a very powerful tool to improve morale.
Combining multiple prestige harmonizers, however, tends to... amplify their effects. Not recommended, but most royals don't seem to care.</description>
