    <label>Temporal manipulation</label>
    <description>Allows you to manipulate time itself. Due to some unchangeable physical laws, the device will revert the universe back only as much time as it takes to charge (therefore creating a time loop). The time the device takes to charge can be changed, but it will use exponentially more power.\n\n...Have we gone too far?</description>
