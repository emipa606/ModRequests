First step download Unity free version and install it if you dont already have it
https://store.unity.com/

When it's done, create a new project then in Assets (bottom left) right click and create two folders "Editor" and "Fonts"
Right-click on the "Editor" folder then "Create" then "C# Script"
Name it "BundleBuilder"
Double click on it then copy paste this code :

====================
using UnityEditor;
using System.IO;

public class CreateAssetBundles
{
    [MenuItem("Assets/Build AssetBundles")]
    static void BuildAllAssetBundles()
    {
        string assetBundleDirectory = "c:\\tmp";
        if (!Directory.Exists(assetBundleDirectory))
        {
            Directory.CreateDirectory(assetBundleDirectory);
        }
        BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles(assetBundleDirectory, BuildAssetBundleOptions.None, BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows);
    }
}

====================
* (You need to create a tmp folder in your C: disk's root)
====================

Then simply drag and drop fonts (ttf or otf format) in the "Fonts" folder
Warning : fonts name file need to be properly prefixed with a unique prefix you choose (eg : MyPrefix_fontname.ttf) otherwise it can lead to fonts packs incompatibilities

After all fonts are dragged in the "Fonts" folder, add a new AssetBundle by clicking on the select control (just after the "AssetBundle" text) on the bottom right of you screen
Click on "New" name it with a unique name "MyAssetBundle" validate by hit ENTER
Now got o you "Fonts" folder (in Unity) , hit CTRL + A (select all fonts), then in "AssetBundle" select list just select your previously created AssetBundle name
You now to make your font pack, simply click on "Assets" menu then select "Build AssetBundles"
It's done you font package is in your c:\tmp folder
