<description>Noobert Nebulous is a mod created in partnership with Vanilla Expanded team, and allows you to become a famous vidtuber out in the Rim. By creating a streaming console, you can designate your colonists to become vidtubers and create videos. Depending on the selected tags and the skills of your colonist, your videos will attract more or less new views, generate new subscribers, cause people to unsubscribe and most importantly - generate revenue.

By gaining a large following, you will be able to release viral videos that attract hundreds of thousands of viewers, and ultimately yield a passive income every month based on those views.

Noobert Nebulous storyteller however will dial things up to the maximum. He will generate positive events on your way down, and strong negative events on your way up. Raids will be much more difficult, however you will receive a strong positive mood buff upon defeating them.

But don’t you dare to lose any of your vidtubers. Their death will result in a strong mood debuff.

Most of the settings in this mod can be adjusted in Mod Options.
