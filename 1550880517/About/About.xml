  <description>RimFace adds completely new high quality faces in Rimworld. Give each colonist an individual appearance!

Load after Facial Stuff.

Load after Spoons Hair [If you have this mod]

Use only with Camera+, without zoom you will not see the difference.

Features:
More than a hundred new eyes, brown, blue, green and purple flowers.
Completely redrawn mouths, eyebrows, wrinkles and added bionic parts.
Heads were redrawn and modified, noses are added for the side view.
Some beards are now displayed along with the mouths.

This mod is save-friendly (adding and removing).
No gameplay mechanics are touched, only the visuals are changed.

Special thanks:
