  <description>Currently adds two new coastline types:\n\nPeninsula\nHas only one land border for easy defense\n\nIsland\nHas no land borders. No traders, raids or new wildlife can appear.\n\nThese only appear on tiles that border ocean tiles (or single tiles in oceans in the case of islands).\nNot every coast is a peninsula and the chance of one appearing can be changed in the settings.\n\nThis mod is in beta and needs further testing, especially in the case of islands which have no land borders on the maps edge.\nIslands may cause all sorts of issues but from preliminary testing this has not caused any errors.</description>
