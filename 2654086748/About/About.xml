  This mod allows other mods to get what type of stone would be at a place if it were exposed stone terrain. Without modifying how stone types are distributed around the map, this isn't possible, believe it or not. Strangely, by default, it uses a random seed each time. This means that after the map is generated there's no way to know what that seed was and thus no way to find out what stone would go where.
  
  You don't need this unless a mod you want to use is dependent on it, but if you think you might use one of those mods in the future then you could use this by itself. It will change the stone generation on its own but this won't have any obvious impact on your game without a mod that depends on that change.
  
  For modders, to get the stone type at a particular cell, add the assembly reference to this mod and then do something like the following:
  var st = Map.GetComponent&lt;CMS.MapComponent_StoneGrid&gt;().StoneTypeAt(c);
  
  Be sure to add it as a dependency for your mod in the Steam upload so it's easy for users to find and install this dependency!
