# Cheers 4 Hobbits!
Mod for RimWorld that treats humanlikes with body size less than 1.0 as body size 1.0 (same as humans) for the purposes of drug effect, tolerance, and most importantly, addiction, effectively no longer penalizing them for their smaller body size.

"Drug" includes not only hard drugs like yayo and go-juice, but also milder substances like beer and psychite tea, and even non-addictive drugs like penoxycyline (although at body size <= 1.0, a single dose of penoxycyline has max effectiveness anyway).

Although this mod was originally intended for [Lord of the Rims Hobbits], this is a standalone mod that works with all humanlikes with <1.0 body size.

Note that body size itself is not changed, so all the many other effects from body size (such as food needs, carrying capacity) are unchanged.

## Compatibility
Should be safe to add and remove from existing save games.

Should be compatible with other mods, including modded drugs and [custom races], as long as they don't patch the same methods this mod patches (and even then, it's still possible they're compatible).
