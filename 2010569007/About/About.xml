This mod adds a variety of Neon signs to Rimworld! Your colonists are not blocked by them either, being wall-mounted, however
they do require power to run. To get the neon signs research Colored Lights. This mod is compatible with all saves, and as long
as all signs are deconstructed can be removed safely.
