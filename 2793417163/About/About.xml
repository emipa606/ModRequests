Poser!

Are all your animal friends frustratingly mobile? Don't you wish you could sweep up those loveable creatures and preserve them in playful stasis for eternity?

Well now you can! With Universal Taxidermy, you can hold those precious souls forever. Set your loved one where you can always enjoy their treasured company, by stuffing their corpse with salt and wood!

After you've made a Mount, store it in a Plaque and make sure there is enough Plinth area to hold the beast.

Changelog:

Changed the rendering of humanlike pawns when displayed so that heads and hairstyles are properly displayed. The Mount graphic is still the basic render.
Fixed humanlike rotation rendering on displays and added an option on the Plaque to change the display rotation.
Built against 1.4.
