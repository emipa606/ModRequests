Works Controller 1.4

- About this mod -
This mod allows you to set up a set of work that are allowed depending on the skill of the colonists.

It can be used to meet below needs.
-If you want to allow high skilled colonists to work on tasks that affect the quality of the finished product, and low skilled colonists to work on other works.
-I want to set these colonists in a batch because it's too tired to use skill filters for each workbench.
-I would like can be set by skill to the "Animals", the "Construction", the "Medical", and other work that cannot be set depending on the skill.

It can be used to meet such needs.
Also, The settings will be retained in each saved data.

- How to use -
Press the "WC" button that is added to the lower right corner of the display to open the settings screen.
The rest should be pretty obvious.

- Install and Uninstall -
When installing, please be aware that this mod depends on the Harmony mod.
When uninstalling, there is nothing to be aware of.
The next time you load the game, you'll get a small error only once.
This is an insignificant error message that tells you, "I find the undefined mod's data in your save data, so I'm going to revert to vanilla".
(In the first place, the error is such that it is not even displayed unless you are in development mode.)
In short, it can be safely uninstalled.
