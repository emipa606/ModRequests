Overrides core furniture textures. 
Some constructions can be in new sizes, also I added some items (new table sizes). And remove 2x4 table (I think it's really big). 
I will update this pack when I will draw new stuff. 

Support me on patreon, it will motivate me to continue: https://www.patreon.com/cattleya . I public here some sketches, ideas, thoughts and anounces. Also be free to write me, maybe will draw some things for you for Rimworld!
