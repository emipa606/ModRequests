    <MW_Storyteller.description>Dalaoyan Khan was the holder of the Khan's Order of Heaven and the founder of the Mughal civilization. \n\nIn the heroic epic created by Tanaulan Khan, "Cruelty" is always the main theme of the colonial story. As a person who grew up amidst tribal vendettas and struggles for power, Tan Laochen would not trust anyone but himself. But he firmly believes that Tengger will give everyone a chance to hone their skills, and he is willing to see the scene of resuscitation again and again. Correspondingly, those who are brave and upward will be rewarded by him, so no matter how difficult it is, you can't let go of even a shred of hope. \n\nIn his story, there are only two choices left for the colony - either conquer the entire planet or be conquered by another civilization. Endless attacks will be the main theme of this epic. Instead of enduring day and night attacks, why not do as he said and kill other civilizations in their cradles?</MW_Storyteller.description>
