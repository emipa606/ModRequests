<description>This mod adds a collection of hairstyles that contain glasses! Now pawns can wear hats, accessories and glasses at the same time. All hairstyles have been rendered at 512 x 512 resolution, so it should work with all upscaling mods.

Most of the hairstyles will appear on pawns in the wild, but some can only be accessed with the Ideology styling station or mods that allow you to edit pawns' looks. This is so that the hairstyles pool isn't oversaturated with pawns wearing glasses.
