		<description>A special glove used to summon a Grimm Beetle and steal the power of Aura users. Not much is known about the glove but, it has a connection to the leader of the Grimm. Stealing an Aura is an act of evil and has severe consequences, which can damage the relationship between pawns and even other factions. \n\nThe stolen Aura's power will be absorbed into the glove and can be consumed later on. If the consuming person doesn't have an Aura, the person will obtain the stolen Aura's full potential. Otherwise this will increase the Aura's strenght and certain abilities from the stolen Aura (which are not Aura specific) become available. Consuming the stored Aura's power will destroy the glove.</description>
