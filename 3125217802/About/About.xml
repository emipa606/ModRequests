	this mod adds walls that self regenerate when given certain fuels

There are currently 3 types with different prerequisites

        1) Wooden living wall (no additional requirements)
                 wooden living walls have no upkeep but have slower health regen and are weak to fire 
        2) Amoeboid living wall (requires vanilla nutrient paste expanded)
                 Amoeboid living walls use nutrient paste supplied from a nutrient paste pipe network and have average regen and are nearly immune to fire
        3) Bioformed living wall (requires Vanilla Races expanded: Sanguophage)
                 Bioformed living walls use hemogen supplied from the hemogen pipe network, have the highest regen speed, higher max health and are resistant to fire (not immune!)
