Non-NSFW Version

This is a standalone hypnosis mod that allows you to change your colonist's minds (change their traits, and maybe add skills)
There will be varying types of hypnosis that can be researched, such as crystal necklaces and drugs being a tribal method
This is unlikely to be balanced, but I will attempt to make the process slow and require multiple sessions to be permanant

Includes plugins to Religions of the Rim 2.0
