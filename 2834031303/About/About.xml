	<description>"All Tomorrows" is a book written by C. M. Kosemen, published as a free PDF, that narrates the speculative evolution of humanity billions of years in the future. Several future human species have evolved through genetic engineering. Some of them resemble humans, while 
others not so much.  But they are all descendants of humanity in one way or another.\n\nThe book isn't very long, but mentions lots of species and stories this mod can't cover fully. In order to understand the lore, I highly recommend you reading the book or watching some Youtube videos or podcasts that cover these species more broadly than this mod can.
\n\nThis mod attempts to integrate some All Tomorrows races into RimWorld, while I try to describe them and portrait them as failthful and precise as I can, there are some limitations and balance adjustments I have to make in order to make them enjoyable, fun, and playable. Consider this mod as an ADAPTATION and not a 100% correct replica.</description>
