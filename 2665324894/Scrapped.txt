How's it going, file explorer?

I figured I'd add all the things I've scrapped in the process of making this mod, for people like you.

*Ahem*

- Detachable eyes: I scrapped this because I was lazy and didn't actually wanna do it.

- "Torian" and "Asgoatian": These appear as last names for Dreemurrs, but during the planning process I was going to name the race one of these two things.

- Horn colors: Since Ralsei has colored horns in Deltarune, I figured it would be spiffy if I did that in RimWorld too. They looked weird but if I had tweaked them enough they might've looked good. This idea isn't entirely scrapped.

Yeah I didn't actually scrap too many things, but I hope you enjoyed reading nonetheless.
