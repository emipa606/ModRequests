	<name>Minecarts - Get Haul'n Update</name>
	<author>Compilatron</author>
	<description>Move stuff from A to B with minecarts! Currently an early build, I hope to add more features and improvements later.
	
Get Haul'n update includes revamped vehicle physics, connectable minecart trains and automatic pickup and dropoff points, along with general balance changes and a glossy new look.
	
Credit to Mic for the minecart textures; They did a great job :D
	
Also a special thanks to everyone in the RimWorld discord server who had to go through the agonizing pain of explaining to me how to mod RimWorld.</description>
