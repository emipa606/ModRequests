1. You can build R&amp;D Bench and use it to reverse engineer things. You can reverse engineer buildings too.
If successful in reverse engineering, your research progress towards related technology will be boosted. To be able to reverse engineer a particular thing or building, they should be unlocked by immediately researchable technology. Research progress boost is configurable, but further affected by thing's quality, hit points and amount of other things unlocked by the technology in question.

2. Adds Technology Blueprints to the game. These are rare items that can be dropped by enemies or bought at traders.
Using one will consume it and will give you some progress towards to a random, researchable technology.

There are four types of blueprints:
	- Neolithic blueprints
	- Medieval blueprints
	- Industrial blueprints
	- Spacer blueprints
When you have mastered a technological era, you'll be able to research the capacity to craft your own technology blueprints at a R&amp;D Bench and sell them to traders for profit!

**Blueprints functionality is based on forked, updated and patched version of "Technology Blueprints" mod by Smuffle, LOLKAT_KOMRAD_94.**

**Should be added after any mod adding new factions, traders or modifying research**
