=============== M-13's Safe Batteries and Conduits ===============

This is a mod about a safe batteries and conduits. 
This will provide you with 2 extra batteries (1 with glow, 1 without) that can be used in game.
These batteries is a bit more expensive to place and will be less efficient, 
but stores more energy and nullifies electrical fires.
(It's also insulated against rain ;))
This mod now also contains modded versions of the conduits, these do not explode!

Enjoy!
