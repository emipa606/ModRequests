  <!-- EN: In the New Era AR project, it lost the bid against the KAC KS-1. The reason was that during the bidding process, a tester liked the gun so much that he bought it anonymously. After experiencing a malfunction with his purchased weapon, he took it to the official after-sales service for repair, where he was frustrated by the extremely poor customer service and the dual-pricing standards between military and civilian versions. This situation ultimately led to the cancellation of the gun's bid. -->
  <SIGMCX_FB.description>在新时代AR项目中，与KAC KS-1竞标落选。原因是因为在竞标时一名测试人员非常喜欢该枪，私下匿名购买。直到自己购买的武器出现了故障后，去官方售后店进行维修，被售后工作人员极差的服务态度和军民两版双标的价格给气得够呛。最后直接取消了该枪的竞标</SIGMCX_FB.description>
