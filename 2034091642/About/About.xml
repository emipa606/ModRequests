Most early-game refuelable buildings no longer require refueling.  This
includes torch lamps, braziers, campfires, passive coolers, stoves, and
smithies, and similar early-game buildings from other mods.  This mod
does not affect generators, spaceships, or electric devices.

If you like the idea but think this goes too far, you might like the
Infinite Torches mod, which only affects torch lamps.

Please feel free to request compatibility for any modded buildings that
aren't included - just leave a comment with a link to the mod.  As a 
general guideline, let's limit this mod to wood- or chemfuel-consuming
buildings that don't require components for their construction.

Also patches buildings from:
- Royalty DLC (Braziers)
- Ideology DLC (Darktorches)
- Big Advanced Passive Cooler Redux
- Dubs Bad Hygiene
- Gloomy Vanilla Overhaul
- GloomyFurniture
- Stick Lantern (Continued)
- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production
- Wall Torches Expanded
- Wall Torches Expanded Easy

This mod:
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Should be loaded after Gloomy Vanilla Overhaul (if you use it).
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list if you don't use Gloomy Vanilla Overhaul.
- Doesn't add or remove any items - it just removes the refuelable property from selected buildings.

Thanks to floboug for the request.
