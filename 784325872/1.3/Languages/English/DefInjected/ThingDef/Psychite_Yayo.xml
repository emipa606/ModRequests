  <Yayo.label>cocaine</Yayo.label>
  <Yayo.description>A refined powdery preparation of the coca plant. When snorted, it produces a rapid euphoric high, dramatically reduces the user's need for rest, and suppresses pain. Like all forms of cocaine, it is addictive, though it is not as addictive as crack cocaine.\n\nBecause of its high cost and refined appearance, many cultures associate cocaine with degenerate wealth. Whether in the throneroom or the boardroom, many hare-brained policy schemes have been developed during cocaine-fueled binge parties.</Yayo.description>
