Version 1.4.0.0

Load order
// HugsLib
// Animal Gear

Makes it possible for animals to have "gear" / clothes like normal colonists. 
What they should wear can be set through outfits in the animal tab (like normal colonists).

&lt;color=orange&gt;This mod only enables this to be possible, there are no clothes/gear for animals in this mod.&lt;/color&gt;\n

Short tutorial: "How to make some clothes":

- Get the mod "Animal Gear Basic" to have an example.

- To get an item in the game, you only need the XML with the item-infos and the matching textures 
(a basic one for the item on the ground and 3 per animal)
- Important parts in the XML: 

1. For which bodypart is this piece of clothing for example wolfs: "\AnimalGear\Helper\Bodies_Animal_Quadruped.xml_Info"
one item of clothing can only be for animals that all have this bodypart! 
      (groups)
        (li)Neck(/li)
      (/groups)
and then in your XML:
      (bodyPartGroups)
        (li)Neck(/li)
      (/bodyPartGroups)

2. This defines that this is an item only for animals and which specific animals can use this item, 
in this case the timber and artic wolf (each needs a set of textures, even if they are in this case the same)
You can find the excact names in "\RimWorld\Mods\Core\Defs\ThingDefs_Races\" 
and in this case "Races_Animal_WildCanines.xml" (defName)WolfTimber(/defName)
      (tags)
        (li)Animal(/li)
        (li)WolfArctic(/li)
        (li)WolfTimber(/li)
		...
      (/tags)

- There is a texture at "\Mods\AnimalGear\Helper\ItemName.png" 
that can be helpful to see how the item shows up on the animal or as a placeholder when testing

- As animals don't have seperate head-textures, clothes have to be drawn different then for pawns
(see "dogscarf_Husky_front.png" for example)

If you have different life-stage or female graphics defined, 
the mod looks for them first like this [normalDefName]_[lifeStageIndex]_female
for example "item_WolfTimber_0_back.png" instead of normally "item_WolfTimber_back.png" 
for the youngest version otherwise it uses the normal texture 
(you still need to define all 3 textures for this variant!)
