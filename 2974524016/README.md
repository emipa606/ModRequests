# Description
* A framework using Harmony and Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) to allow for mechanical humanlike pawns with the intelligence of humans and all that comes with it.

## Features
* This mod itself has the bare minimum content necessary to have mechanical pawns, including mechanical analogues for medicine and solutions for charging.
* An extensive mod settings page allowing for reconfiguring various races as mechanical and settings for controlling various aspects of mechanical pawns.

## Known Issues / Incompatibilities
* Activating Self-Tend on a mechanical pawn will throw a message at you complaining that the Doctor work type is not assigned even if the pawn has the Mechanic work type assigned (It's harmless, mechanical pawns will self-tend based on Mechanic, not Doctor).
