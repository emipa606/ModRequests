But to [PAWN_possessive] surprise, the factory was well into the green, and the lawsuits seemed to magically disappear after enough time passed. [PAWN_nameDef] wanted to dive deeper, but considered the high turnover [PAWN_possessive] job had and decided against angering a high-ranking executive. Or maybe the high turnover was due to accountants being sent out in raiding parties for some reason.</baseDescription>
