This mod adds extra compatibility for Variety Matters with Vanilla Cooking Expanded and More Archotech Garbage.

The first thing this mod does is make desserts from Vanilla Cooking Expanded be treated as proper meals, so their ingredients will now be tracked (great if you have mods that introduce more fruits to be used!) - originally they were treated as simple meals, which means they didn't track the ingredients at all, which could cripple variety for frequent dessert eaters.

Second, gourmet meals from Vanilla Cooking Expanded and Archotech meals from More Archotech Garbage should now be treated as their own separate category, instead of being treated as lavish meals. This means that pawns will get more variety if they only eat them, and even more if they mix them with lavish meals.

All changes can also be toggled on/off in the mod options!
