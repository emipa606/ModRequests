  <AFerian.description>Ferian, they are a product of another galaxy,
		\nTheir Technology is incredible; Their Culture is divine; Everything about them is unimaginable...
		\n\nInto our world, on their spaceship, with nothing.
		\n\nTheir tiny body, and their implausible ability with blood-pumping makes them smarter, smarter, and more dangerous than any other creature in this world. At the same time, extremely thick blood can also minimize the natural environment to their harm.
		\nThese heavenly-born furries couldn't do any heavy physical work. Because of the Sydaily Crystal in their heads, they must eat large amounts of food constantly to not pass out from weakness.
		\n\nThey are not afraid of death, they just take this adventure as a game, but in fact,
		\nTheir bodies are just vehicles for their consciousness.
		\nAfter the Sydaily Crystal in the head of the Ferian is completely extinguished, it will soon be "Load the Save" on their spaceship.
		\n\n“Instead of eternal peace, we prefer to pursue that never-ending madness.”</AFerian.description>
