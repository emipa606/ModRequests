	\n(Although this alien partner is as Smelly as he thought aliens did .)
	　　　　\n\nAfter that encounter,The two monsters set off on a crazy journey in this rimworld!It's worth noting that they all tried to assimilate into the local aboriginal culture during the journey.
	\n(Although neither of them obeyed any rules.)
