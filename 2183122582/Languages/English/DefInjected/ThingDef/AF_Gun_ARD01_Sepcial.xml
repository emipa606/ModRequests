  <AF_Gun_ARD01_Special.description>May never be included in the official system of the weapon, from the edge of the world struggling to survive the Ferian.
	  \nThis angular weapon came from the edge of the world. Although it makes the subversion of the traditional aesthetic, but we can't do not pick and choose in this crazy continent !
	  \n\nOf course, ARD can never be compared to AGB. But it's also a good substitute for a lack of weapons.
	  \nIt does not require an external connection to the Sydaily crystal, which means it can be used by your alien friends!
      \n\n\n（【S】stands for safe. It's used to stun creatures.）</AF_Gun_ARD01_Special.description>
