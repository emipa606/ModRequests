  <Leather_Ferian.description>OwO ! It's a bottle of lovely loose fox wool!!!
	\nThe Fox's fur becomes particularly brittle when removed from its owner, making it difficult to preserve and make into clothing.
	\nBut a small jar-fur can make a great addition to a collection!</Leather_Ferian.description>
