  <SydailyVine.description>Most of the Conventional weapon are not very effective against the Ferians.
	\nTheir flexible bodies and adapted bodies can avoid most of the damage.
	\nBut some types of injuries are counterproductive to these adaptations,
	\nLike "Blunt Force Trauma (4 times damage)" , "Explosion (2 times damage)' .
	\n\n\n【These damage bonuses also apply to their shields】</SydailyVine.description>
