  <AF_Goods_Card.description>An exquisite postcard with a huge paw print and many fine patterns on it. With unparalleled security records the owner of every moment traces.
	\n\nYou can stick it in your big tail~
	\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------“Your mind, your 'soul', to keep you safe, to ensure that the family of the clan of the Ferian blood will never be lost to a foreign land. Who you are, they're on the ship you're on this adventure in. Do not fear, afraid of their various acts will give their own Ferian Race trouble. When you read this text, you're not who you really are. There's nothing to worry about in this galaxy. Have a good time~ ”</AF_Goods_Card.description>

  <AF_Goods_CardSGU.description>The card has been adjusted so that it can be used as a signal base to transmit the information it collects directly to the spaceship.
	\n\n【The transmission of information will create an very very powerful energy field. It can speed up work, but it can seriously impede the movement of its owner.】
	\n\nIt is worth noting that the card has been so intricately altered that it is no longer 【indestructible】.</AF_Goods_CardSGU.description>
