  <AF_Cloak_SGU_Sydaily.description>The old generation of Ferian's Guard Cloth. It has not been detected when we board the ship. Obviously, its wearer is by no means an ordinary traveler.
\n\nAbandoning the traditional armor-plated design, the pure Sydaily crystal is embedded directly into the interior of the garment.
\nThe Crystal is in close contact with Ferian who wears it. And producing a flawless shield that is safe even from exposure to space.</AF_Cloak_SGU_Sydaily.description>
