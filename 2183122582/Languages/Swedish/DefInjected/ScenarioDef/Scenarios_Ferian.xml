  <FerianScenario.description>DFFerian log（D1），Game Start——
	\n“Our ship is allowed to pass through the wormhole! It's time to say goodbye to this beautiful world for the last time. We don't know what's waiting for us, we don't know how long this wormhole will last either. Maybe we will never come back.”
	         \n\nDFFerian log（D2），the Party——
	\n“The four of us just introduced ourselves and had a little party in the cockpit! All of our friends believed in the adventure, until we started pulling each other's tails for our last snack.”		 
		      \n\nDFFerian log（D6），Difficult to choice——
	\n“They have sent us the location of most of the potentially habitable planets in the cluster, all of them bad ones, with some strange primitive civilizations on them. But there are some advanced interstellar civilizations in the cluster! And we've mastered their language~ But I suspect the engines on this ship are even worse than theirs...”
	         \n\nDFFerian log（D11），Good night——
	\n“Finally, we have chosen a decent planet! We know it's designed to keep technology from leaking, but our ship just looks like it's been dug out of the ruins of an old age underground! Even so, it can travel through the cluster very quickly, but we still need to get some sleep to skip this boring time.”	
	         \n\nDFFerian log（D---），Hewwo——
	\n“Shhhhh. They're still sleeping~ I've just signed my name to the stars of this galaxy~ I can't wait to see the planet's primitive species Gawk's Surprised Face!”	
		     \n\nDFFerian log（Writing...）——
	\n“The ship didn't disappoint... We needed to land on the planet's surface in a disposable lander... This planet looks so strange, my heart has been restless, it is jumping there, trembling, for this unpredictable, but really come to all excited, let's go!”</FerianScenario.description>

  <FerianScenario.scenario.parts.8.text>The lander hit the ground hard. Luckily, you didn't get any "pain".
			\n\n\nWith the hatch opening, you're in a world you've never seen before.
			\n\n\nYou're a little weak in the knees. But the second that your paw goes down, it's just so exciting.
			\n\n\nSo. What's next?</FerianScenario.scenario.parts.8.text>
