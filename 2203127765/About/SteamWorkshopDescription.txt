[b]A simple mod which add a new kind of drug for scar removal after some time.[/b]

[b]How to make?[/b]
Research "Fibropolygen production" (1000 research points, behind "Drug production").
One pill of Fibropolygen is made with: 1 Luciferium and 1 Neutroamine at a Drug Lab production bench.

[b]How to use?[/b]

[b]Why this mod?[/b]
Do you have colonists with something scarred and don't want to go the no return luciferium way but ache to clear their health tab anyway? Well, I do.
This mod reproduces the permanent injuries removal effect of luciferium without the improved stats and withdrawal symptoms.
(The name comes from Fibrosis, Polymer and Collagen.)

Safe to install or remove with ongoing save.
Should be compatible with everything.
