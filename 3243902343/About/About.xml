		Sashimi recipe! It is a Sushi dish added to Vanilla Cooking Expanded's Sushi module! The developer probably thought a fish only sushi dish was too convenient. I still think it's cool to have the option, though! \n\nThere are two variants. The (simple) dish which uses only fish, and the (gourmet) which gives the benefits of both soy sauce and wasabi.\n\nI made this for myself, but all are welcome to try it!\n\n[Art drawn by ShiriaruKita]
