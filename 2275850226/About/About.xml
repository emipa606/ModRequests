	<description>All credit goes to the original author Serpy, all I did was bungle my way through updating the files to (hopefully) get it working properly for 1.0 and beyond, hope everyone enjoys the big monster terriers.  Now with (hopefully) 100% less purple squares!

"A large behemoth of a dog derived from crossbreeding yorkshire terriers with wargs. They are loyal, strong, and have been known to protect their owners to the bitter end."

Yorkshire terrors are similar to wargs in many aspects, except they cannot handle the cold as much as their wargen ancestors can. They are predators and will hunt on their own if not given food directly, and have been seen hunting deer, ibex, boar and even smaller animals. Unlike wargs, they are not restricted to solely eating corpses and kibble (who even thought that was a good idea) and will eat meals, animal products like milk and eggs, and even nutrient paste!
