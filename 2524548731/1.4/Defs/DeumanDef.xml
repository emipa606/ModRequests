        <description>Unlike the artificially created xenotypes, the Deumans have arisen naturally through mutations of the human genome. They can be recognized by their protruding horns, biological antennae with which they can amplify their psychic abilities, and their pale skin and reddish eyes.\n\nThey are a rather nimble xenotype that prefers agility to brute strength, which is due to the fact that they are physically strong and at the same time weak to physical trauma.</description>
