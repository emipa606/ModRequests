        <description>The Newmans are an elven-looking human xenotype who are genetically attuned to psychic phenomena, are very talented in laboratory work, and do not seem to age like normal humans. They split off from normal humanity a long time ago and have since asserted themselves as their own race.\n\nTheir most striking features, besides their extreme sensitivity to the metaphysical, are their long ears and beautiful faces, a cosmetic decision by their creator to visually distinguish them from humans and make them more pleasant to work with.\n\nHowever, all this comes at a price: in the hope of preventing rebellions of this long-lived xenotype, the Newmans were also designed to be extremely weak physically, which severely limits their physical abilities and makes them more susceptible to injury and pain.</description>
