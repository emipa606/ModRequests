  <description>This mod makes it so vanilla cats produce a smal amount of warm "wool", fur, over quite a long period of time, if you're a cat owner you know how it is. \n \n NOTE: I'm not sure which versions does it support exactly except for 1.3 and maybe 1.2, it should be good at least for 1.0 I think...</description>
