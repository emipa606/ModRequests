<description>	Mod Version: 0.2.0

The Omnitron; like having your own multi-talented mechanoid butler that's capable of doing all the normal mechanoid skill jobs, while also being competent in combat. The Omnitron is what you would get if the Agrihand, Constructoid, Lifter, Cleansweeper, Fabricor, Paramedic, and Legionary all had a baby together, and it was born wielding a Heavy Beam Rifle. (don't think about it too much...)

Please submit all bug reports and balance suggestions as Github issues.
https://github.com/alaestor/Rimworld-Omnitron

Balance suggestions are welcome, but I'm unlikely to implement anything new. New features probably won't be added unless someone contributes them via Github pull request.

This mod only exists because I wanted to make it for a personal run and thought others might enjoy. It's XML only; no mod settings. The Omnitron is an amalgamation of vanilla behaviors and the Biotech mechs (with slight stat and balance tweaks). It's rare for me to play Rimworld so it may not recieve many updates in the long-term unless the community contributes them to the git repo. If you'd like to expand upon this mod or update it after I go missing again; feel free to use these assets.
