  On this mod , You need Ammunition to shoot your guns.

 CAUTION:
  ・This mod is NOT savegame compatible.

 MOD PURPOSE:
  Making characteristic for all guns and debuff over powerd guns like charge rifle and sniper rifles.
  Charge rifle need EnergyPack as Ammunition which is so expensive , 
  but Pistol only consume cheap Ammunition. so , maybe there is a situation using Pistol on late games.
  That is this mod's purpose.

 ORVERALL:
  When your colonist or turret shoot guns , guns consume ammunition.
  But they don't need carry ammunitions.
  Ammunition will be consumed from Storage Building named "AmmoBox" on your colony.
  This is storage only for ammunitions.
  If any of "Ammobox" do not have enough ammunition ,
  your colonist and turret can not shoot any single of burret 
  and immediately drop gun to ground or turret's power will be off.
  So, you need keep enough ammunition before the Enemy raids.
  
  There is 3 way to gather ammunitions.
　・EnemyDrop: every combat pawn have few ammo which is suitable type for own primary gun.
  ・Trading: caravan and trader ship will trade ammunition with you.
　・Crafting Ammo: most of ammunition can make from steel and sulfurs.
                   making ammo on Smithy.
                   sulfer can get by digging SteamGeyser using "Sulfur Mining Depot".
                   "Sulfur Mining Depot" need "Smithing" research.
