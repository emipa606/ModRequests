Are your colonists tired of living inside a noisy workshop? Do they get stressed out by the constant buzz from the wind generators or the loud conversations in the hallways? Do they get startled by the turrets constantly firing in the middle of the night? Are they desperate for a chance of taking a walk in the woods, just to have some peace and quiet? Well, with this mod, they will!
