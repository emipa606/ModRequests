		Compacted steel? In *my* mountain? I don't think so! Return to the basics of production chain antics with this iron to steel mod. Used in conjunction with Coal mod, your pawns will now have to work double hard to start building up their steel reserves. Steel is now a manufactured resourced created by combining coal and raw iron at the bloomery or the smithy. Work work work!
		
		Requires the mod [WD] Simple Coal (or any other supported coal/charcoal mod) and place this after it.
		
		Compatible with save games.
