    This mod enables you to listen to any song pack you want (might have unknowns within it).
    It also features a way to skip to the next song, play previous songs, and play/pause. If you want to get rid of the full display, you can also switch to the mini-display.
    This new version of RimRadio also has settings to it.
    
    The main reason to use it is to control how RimWorld music plays. I found it annoying that it is mostly quite and occasionally plays music.
