Why am I seeing this?
You are seeing this license agreement here because RimRadio can use FFmpeg.
Since FFmpeg is an external program, I want you to know that I am not
responsable for any damage done by incorrectly installing FFmpeg, nor
downloading trojans that say they are FFmpeg.

Why did you add a license now?
Since day 1 of this mod, it has been under the GNU GPL v3 license. So if you
have used my mod in the past, either RimRadio or RimRadio: Remade, it was
assumed that you agree to this license. But now that FFmpeg backend has been
implimented, I want to ensure that my ass is covered. I understand if
licenses/legal things are scary, but if you do not trust me, you can always
go to the repo linked the Steam page. That repo contains all of the source
code to my mod. If you do not trust FFmpeg, you do not have to install it,
but its source code is also avialable to the public.
