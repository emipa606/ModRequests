       Do you want to try all new cool retexture mods for the Hot Spring mod, but you dont want to settle just on one texture? Worry not my friend!
       This mod allows you to choose any texture you want, from the installed rextextures supported by this mod of course!
       Place below Standalone Hot Spring mod an allretexutres you want to use.
       ..................................................
       [h1]===============Compatibility Notice===============[h1]
       I wont include mods which introduce new spring retexutres as new buildings (for they are not really retexutres)
       If you feel like I exlcuded a lot of mods, thats true!
       Mods using that are using 'Things/Building/Hotspring_Rtx' as the path for their retexture sadly override ech other. Untill mod authors wont change texture file name and this xpath in hot  spring pathc  I can't include them in options ;c.
       I will try to give heads up for retexutres authors to update their patches, if they want to do so of course.
       [h1]KNOWN BUGS[h1]
       Sometimes you will see red error about dupicate XML node, it's harmless really, and you should not care about it at all.
