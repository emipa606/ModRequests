				SI
		Runic 
			Not really feasible lore wise.  Would have to be limiting or else it would negate need for reagents.
			Possibility: Require a blackrock generator or similiar devise to create high mana zone.
			Research: Runecraft
		Totem - 
			Probably drop this as it only has 9 spells and not all translate well.
			Possibility: new spells? for total of 9
	Research
		Runecraft for Runic spells
			Allow crafting of runes.

			
Research
~~~~~~~~
Serpentwyne - Cure Poison, Restore Health, prolong life 'of the eldery'
	Prolonging life may be tricky.  Extend lifetime for individual? or reduce age by a small amount?
		Ideally, should not be an immortality potion but should still be effective.
		% Chance to cure age related conditions?
			Reduce stages gradually
	Still a wine / alchohol / drug with addition chance & joy.
	Should have quality
