          <li>setup(tag=meme_Individualist)           ->In creating the Fellowship philosophy I had no intention of cobbling together a collection of platitudes that would be presumptuously intended as a replacement of the Eight Virtues of The Avatar. I knew there would be those who would accuse me of doing just that, no matter what philosophy I developed! I hereby wish to state that The Fellowship fully supports the Eight Virtues of the Avatar, and as one who has endeavored to follow their example I can personally assure thee of their immeasurable worth.
But as one who has followed the Eight Virtues, I know whereof I speak when I say that it is impossible to perfectly live up to them. Even the Avatar was unable to do so continuously and consistently. Can anyone say that they have been honest every moment of every day of their lives? Can anyone say that they are always compassionate, valorous, just, sacrificing, honorable, humble or spiritual at all times? The philosophy of the Eight Virtues does little more than emphasize our own personal deficiencies. I have met many adherents to the ways of the Virtues who are racked with guilt over what they perceive to be their spiritual failures, for that is what the Virtues are based upon. Having been shown our weaknesses, now is the time to strengthen them. The philosophy of The Fellowship has been created to eradicate the failures from one's life. It is a philosophy based upon success and it enhances everything that has come before it. The Fellowship philosophy can be expressed as three values derived from the personal experiences of my life. They are known as The Triad of Inner Strength.</li>

          <li>story(uses=1,tag=meme_Individualist)    ->I must not forget The Fellowship! Though not a member, myself, I can tell thee a little about it. For example, the first branch was established here in Britain by Batlin, himself! In fact, he is still the head here. Batlin is an excellent person to whom the Avatar shouldst speak about joining. And, Britain has the greatest number of members in all of Britannia, though I hear Buccaneer's Den is highest in its member to non-member ratio. But who would rather live there than here, except retired pirates and gamblers!</li>
