	<description>Ever been confused why the vanilla game lacks any eye prosthetics simpler than a bionic eye? Ever been annoyed there's no easier way to cover up those disfiguring eye scars? Ever been mad there aren't more prosthetics using the new eye textures? Well be mad no more, with these brand new eye prosthetics that solve all your eye-related needs from neolithic times all the way into the industrial age.
They blend right into the vanilla game!
