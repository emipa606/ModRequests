the reason I randomly talk about scooby doo in the comments:
if someone asks a question they could have answered themselves by reading the description, or asks for a request in a
way I consider rude, I will completely ignore what they wrote and pretend they asked me a question pertaining to scooby doo.
I will then helpfully answer this make-believe question.
