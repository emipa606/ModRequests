  <MMTank_SUNAMAMIREN.description>It is said that it was made before the great destruction, but details are unknown.\nIt is buried in a desert, and most humans pass by without even noticing it, but it seems that a skilled hunter can dig in one shot without a metal detector.\nIt is equipped with a very hot metal detector, and when it's free, it picks up iron scraps and components.</MMTank_SUNAMAMIREN.description>
