&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Ever thought having only 2 types of mechanoids was kinda... on the boring side?
Ever wanted a purely melee-attacking mechanoid?
Or maybe a mechanoid that would blow up your base and everyone you love with a freaking grenade launcher?
If you have answered "yes" to at least one of those questions, this mod may or may not be for you!

&lt;size=20&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
- 5 new types of mechanoids that will be appearing in raids/poison + psychic ship parts/ancient dangers:
	- Vespa: a quick, frail mechanoid capable of using cover,
	- Goliath: melee-only, somewhat tanky mechanoid that explodes upon dying,
	- Hound: a mechanoid equipped with a set of power claws as well as a brand new grenade launcher,
	- Kraken: a huge mechanoid with high HP, that has a chance to be spawned with any of the weapons the mechanoids are using,
	- Chimera: a mechanoid that was put together from scraps of the other types, equipped with a built-in inferno cannon, as well as a scyther's blade.

- 1 new artificial body part, the mecha-tentacle, that can be obtained by deconstructing a kraken type mechanoid.

&lt;size=20&gt;Languages&lt;/size&gt;
English, Polish, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Hungarian.

&lt;size=20&gt;Credits&lt;/size&gt;
NorX Aengell - French translation,
