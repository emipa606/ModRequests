# Archite Capsule Extractor
[![Archite Capsule Extractor](About/Preview.png)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959446434)

Extract archite capsules (not genes!) from pawns, obviously killing them in the process.
But pawns must have at least one archite gene to be applicable.
Requires corresponding research.

One capsule always guaranteed, each next one has 75% chance of extraction.
I.e. 10-th capsule will have ~7% chance.

## Verified compatible/supported mods
