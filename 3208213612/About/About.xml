	<description>This mod adds a "Main Character Plot Armor" trait that makes a pawn unlikely to die: impervious to damage, disease, heat/cold, bad moods, mental/pain breaks, fire/toxins. They are fast at running, learning, researching (but global work speed is unchanged). They always hit targets and dodge attacks. And as all main characters are: they are beautiful. This mod is good for single-pawn colonies. Use the "Edb Prepare Carefully" mod or dev mode to add this trait to your pawns. The code is based on "Plot Armor" by Wrightc214 but with modifications and bug fixes.</description>
