Release 1.1.0

-Fixed typo in Fairytale kid and youthful leader

-Tweaked commonalities around a baseline of 50% for extraordinary pawns.
-Added more commonalities to enable certain backstories to actually be useable.(backstories that have zero spawn conditions cannot be used even in Prepare Carefully/Character Edit, so by adding them to the spawn pool with a hilariously low commonality, they can be made useable without showing up uninvited in regular gameplay.)
-Added 2 backstories inspired by live-action heroes. Try to guess who they are!
-Tweaked some backstory stats
	-PW Doctors can now actually do doctoring
-Made annotations for adding RWoM support and Vanilla Traits expanded support. This won't help existing games, but pawns you encounter in the future with my backstories will become much more... colorful.
