  <description>[h1]Terrain Zone Selections[/h1]

An interface-only mod which adds zone buttons for stockpiles and growing zones. These new buttons create a zone, or add to one, based on the terrain clicked. Want to just sow that Fertile Soil? Click on the new grow zone icon and click once.

Additionally there's a shrink zone option using terrain types as well. Selected a few tiles you don't want in a zone? No need to squint at the screen to find the boundaries, just select the Shrink by terrain tile and click once.

The fact the base game doesn't have this has bugged me for a long time, hopefully this helps others who struggle with soil and tile selections at times.
