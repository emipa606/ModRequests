<!--
        There are NO craftable Royalty DLC weapons to patch so this just sits here empty.
        I did look, and I found only one. The Eltex Staff.
        But while it does have a costStuffCount, it isn't designated as buildable anywhere.
        And in all my time play, never saw it as a buildable item. So that also get a skip.
        
        Leaving only...
        
        Empty space....
