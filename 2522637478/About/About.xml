[h1]About:[/h1]
Makes Core and Royalty Armors and Weapons Stuffed.

I'm not at all concerned about balance. It was not the goal of this mod.
I just wanted the items to be stuffed, and I succeeded with flying colors.
[h1]Requirements:[/h1]
You do NOT need Royalty DLC for this mod, but it is highly advised you get that DLC. Worth every coin.

This was made for myself and shared with you people. That's about it. Mod offered as is.

Enjoy, or do not. Eh....
