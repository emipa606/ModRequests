	<description>Desperate Hunger gives animals who wouldn't normally hunt and consume corpses the ability to do so when they are desperately hungry. When their food need is at zero, they may attack other animals who are wounded. When their malnutrition reaches 20% (configurable) they may attack and attempt to eat healthy creatures nearby!</description>
