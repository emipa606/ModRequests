Is that club wielding pirate a high skilled brawler, or a sickly wimp? Do they enjoy relaxing to a good book, or prefer wandering the muffalo fields? What are their passions, dreams, and aspirations?

How do your colonists know any of this?

This mod hides a pawn's bio information from you until they are added safely in your colony. Pawn identity is remembered, so a colonist arrested or sold into slavery will remain known to you. Safe to add and remove from saves.
