	<name>[CZK] SeedsPlease Lite - Seeds Bench Restored</name>
	<description>
A small add-on for SeedsPlease: Lite restoring the seed processing bench to how it looked in the original SeedsPlease mod retexture. 
The benches functionality remains the same as the seed spot in SP:L, but it is reverted back to being an independent bench that can be placed anywhere.
