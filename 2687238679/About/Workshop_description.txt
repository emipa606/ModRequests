[h2]Notable changes[/h2]
[list]
  [*] Calculates an "effective damage" of a weapon based on it's base damage, armor penetration and accuracy.
      Then, it uses this "effective damage" to calculate how many units of ammo the weapon uses per shot, based on cost of that ammo type.
      This results in same cost per "effective damage".
  [*] Changes how much ammo is produced (3x more) and ammo stack sizes (4x more) to better fit above changes
  [*] Primitive ammo only uses wood. This is to simplify cost calculation. And using something else made no sense.
  [*] Balance Spacer Special so it's per-unit price is same as other Spacer ammo. For consistency.
  [*] Make ammo require specific research before it can be produced

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
As long as mod uses vanilla gun mechanics, it should be compatible.
Incompatibility is mostly in mod doing something special for gun mechanics, thus not having correct vanilla parameters from which the "effective damage" is calculated.
