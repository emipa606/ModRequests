  <description><![CDATA[View remaining resources needed to finish a project (e.g. your escape ship).
A must-have for speedrunning.

<color=teal><b>Versatile ship presets.</b></color>
The following presets are included:
* ship reactor only
* ship minimum (1 cryptosleep casket)
* ship for map colonists (X cryptosleep caskets)
* ship for all colonists (Y cryptosleep caskets)

<color=teal><b>Deep-count ingredients.</b></color>
A readout of not only the main resources you still need, but the recipe ingredients to make them.

<color=teal><b>Count inside relevant building frames.</b></color>
If the construction is a part of your goal, its resources are still counted, but if not they will be needed again.

<color=teal><b>Performance.</b></color>
Only updates as often as ordinary resource counter.

<color=teal><b>Mod compatibility.</b></color>
All ship presets are generated from <color=grey>ShipUtility.RequiredParts()</color>, and will work fine if modified.
Recipes to deep-count ingredient are found automatically, and changeable. Custom goals are also possible.

<color=teal><b>Custom goals.</b></color>
Currently only possible through save-game editing, find the <color=grey>ResourceGoalTracker</color> <color=grey><goal></color> section, delete <color=grey><usePreset></color>, and adjust the parts to whatever you desire.
(With usePreset the goal section isn't read, it's merely for example.)

<color=teal><b>Select recipe per resource.</b></color>
By default, the first found recipe is used (and vanilla only has 1 per resource).
With mods, you may like to select which recipe ingredients you'd like counted.
Currently only possible through save-game editing, find the <color=grey>ResourceGoalTracker</color> <color=grey><recipes></color> section, and edit as desired.
(Blank the value to remove, i.e. <color=grey><li></li></color> though this will produce a harmless error.)
