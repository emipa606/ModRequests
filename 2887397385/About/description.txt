[h3]Notes[/h3]
[*]This mod overrides some settings of Varied Body Sizes
[*]Please be aware that small bodies have quite a few disadvantages, your maximum hunger gauge, health, carrying capacity, melee damage, and threshold for dismemberment are lower. Your dodge chance is higher.
[*]There are some issues drawing facial genes, I'm working on it.
