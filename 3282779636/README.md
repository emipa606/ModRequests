# VAGUE (Vanilla Android Genes Unofficially Expanded)!
Cool name, isn't it. No? Too bad.

This mod adds a bunch of new subroutines to VRE:Androids, most of which are just copies of existing base game genes, like movespeed and such.

This was originally a more ambitious project that was going to include some more special genes, but I decided to start small and have the more ambitious portions of this project be a separate project.
