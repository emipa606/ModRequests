リムワールドにハロウィンのおばけ達を追加します。ハロウィンのお菓子を落とすカボチャ3種、美味しい秋の収穫を落とすコウモリ達と歩くキノコ、周囲の温度を下げるゴースト、ろうそくを置いてまわるカカシ、こわーい死神さん。全部で8種。
Living pumpkins, scary cute bats, bouncy mushrooms, and even ghosts! Halloween has truly come to the Rim; and, with all the different solar systems it has, it’s always Halloween on some planet, right? But these little baddies aren’t just here for pranks, they’re also pretty sweet: colonists harvest various sweets from three different breeds of living pumpkins; mushrooms and bats also have some goodies to share; scarecrows help keep the dark away by placing down candles ; ghosts keep it cool by lowering the temperature of whatever room they’re in; and reapers, well, like the ghosts, they can help carry the load in a caravan. In total, this mod introduces 8 animals. Have fun, and happy Halloween!
