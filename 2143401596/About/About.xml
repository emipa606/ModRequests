	   <description> I was always bothered that meditation was supposed to be something often done out in nature, away from the rest of the colony, yet it required you place unnatural green shapes surrounding your meditation focus.
In an effort to remedy that, this mod changes the texture of the vanilla meditation spot to be invisible. The name of who the spot belongs to remains. Compatible with anything that doesn't change the texture as well.
