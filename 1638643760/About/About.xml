  <description>This is a simple mod that adds leather armor into the game. The leather armor is built at a tailoring table like clothing, and is available after researching complex clothing (dusters, pants, etc.).
The leather armor uses the material properties of the leather used in its construction. Leather armor is meant to be an early alternative to plate armor. It is less protective than plate, but doesn't hamper movement.

I built this mod when I noticed that there wasn't a good alternative to plate armor early in the game and at low tech levels. This mod now includes new textures for the armor.

Compatibility:
- Compatible with existing saved games.
- Compatible with all mods.</description>
