V1.644
* Updated the Chinese Translation Files, thanks to VoiceVoice for this GREAT work...
* Mineable Adamantium Commonality reduced from 0.28 to 0.15
* Mineable Promethium Commonality reduced from 0.1 to 0.07
* Mineable Ceramite Commonality reduced from 0.25 to 0.23
* All Lump Sizes for mineable resources decreased by 30% this means individual deposits should be smaller.
* But to add a little compensation for this "balance" I have increase mineable yield per block for Ceramite up for 24 to 30
* Due to increase rarity of the Wh40k ores i have upped their base value by 10 silver per ore so not to disturb people who use these ores for sales.
* Lowered market value of refined ceramite from 250 to 200. I think they were over priced.
* Updated Description of the Lasgun "Nylem Pattern Lasgun" in honour of Nylem, thanks for your support.

V1.643
* Updated description of the Auto-gun in Honor of the "Aurathas" Rimworld YouTube Play-through with Astra Militarium Mod.
* Fixed Imperial Bed to work with End Table & Dressers
* Lowered Hitpoints of Promethium to 15000 from 30000 - it was just too high...
* For those wondering, lowering the Adamantium to make it mine quicker weakens walls made by it, so this is why Adamantium is 30000.

V1.642
* Fixed Sort Bug for Tyranid Stew.

V1.641 - Early Game Balance Changes
* You can now also build AutoGuns at the Machining Table. Enable early game access to this gun.
* Removed the need for some of the Research items needing a Multi-Analyser. Enables some earlier game access to some stuff.
* Lowered Research count for "Basic Imperial Construction" Research to enable better early game access to items.
* Lowered Research count for "Imperial Metals" Research to enable better early game access to items.
* Added Small Stocks of Uranium and Gold to the Rogue Trader

V1.64
* Increased considerably the Capability of the Void Shield Belt, makes Melee Pawns using Imperial Melee Weapons far more viable.
* New "Rogue Trader" Orbital TraderKind, who stocks Imperial Items. Good way of getting those imperial items when a little short to be able to make stuff.
* Rogue Trader will always have a basic stock of AutoGuns. Use them early in game if you're finding it difficult.
* Added Trader Tags to all Tradeable Items.
* Added Market Values to Melee Weapons, so they can be sold by Rogue Trader
* Balanced a number of Market Values on various items. mostly lowered, but a few increased.
* Moved the "Tyranid Stew" items from the Factions Mod to the Core mod, this enabled the Rogue Trader to sell this item even if you dont have the Factions mod installed. Should not affect existing Save Games.

V1.63 - Changes I wanted based on my 20 hour playthrough.
* Fabricators can now be moved, and packaged for storage.
* Imperial Bed and Hospital Bed can now be packaged and moved.
* Increased Frequency of Orbital Traders using Mod Storytellers from 10 days to 2 days.
* Lowed Stuff Costs for Jump Suit, from 500 to 100.
* Reduced Work Required to make imperial resources at the Imperial Fabricator, by around 30%
* Increase Planetary Core Extractor Amounts by about 20%, and reduced work amount required by 10%. Mainly because you need more and more of these resources each time i add items.

V1.62
* Changed the build requirements for planetary extractor to be more toward vanilla resources, because it can be too hard to get the amount of Refined Ceramite required.
* All Imperial Weapons are now Smelt-able to get resources back from them.

V1.61
* UrlockGaur Story Teller fixed "again" to work with Hospitality mod, the Chaos Undivided Story Teller was already working with Hospitality Mod.
* ThingsCatagories, has been changed as it affected the used of outfit control etc. so rather than all IG Mods coming under its own route area then are now under the appropriate Vanilla categories BUT still in their own groups. Example, Helmets are in Apparel - Imperial Apparel - Imperial Guard Headgear.
* Carapace Armor can now user Servo Arms and Flak Plates. This will make you pawns even tougher :) and not versitle.. Might be overpowered please feedback.

V1.6
* Core Mod Update for Tyranid Faction Support, some new Textures, Sounds, Thoughts defs etc. These have no affect on Core Game without the factions mod.
* Story Tellers UrlockGaur has been moved from Faction Mod to be part of Core Mod. Should not affect any games already using the story tellers.
* Added New Story Teller, Chaos Undivided - Expect Chaos...
* Made the story teller xml better and should provide a better challenge, and now be compatible with Hospitality Mod.
* Fixed Paradox Poker Table - Pawns will now play this game and get great joy from doing do.
* New more 3D looking Paradox Poker Table, and MenuIcon.
* Re-Balanced Webber, having tested it would incapacitate a raid 5 vs 8 not problems. The Accuracy has been decreased 20% accross all ranges, also reduced the unConscious Affect to be 7% instead of 15% and last 1.5 day instead of 20 days. These weapons are really suppose to be secondary weapons to capture a targeted pawn.
* ThingCatagories has been completely redesigned for all Core and Addon Mod Items, now when looking in store zones etc you will see a new line for "Imperial Guard Mod" and all items added by the core mod and any addons mods will appear under here in appropiate groups, so you can create storage zones easily for Mods items. Looks like a small change but there were 50+ changes to XML all over the place to sort this, so could be buggy..
* New ThingCatagories does not apply to Foods or Furniture, these still sit in the original vanilla sections, as there seems to be some hardcoding going on.
* Imperial Hospital Bed has been re-balanced quality of care has been reduced from 104% to 60%, the standard hospital bed is 10%.
* Added Imperial Thermal Plant - Double output of the Vanilla Thermal Generator, about 30% harder to build than Vanilla Gen, and uses Imperial Resources.
* Toned Down, Imperial Resources required to build High End Power Buildings
* Imperial Research Cogitator is a new device that functions the same as the Multi-Analyser, to get most out of this device make sure is the only device connected to your "Hi_Tech Research" Bench, you will still need a "multi-analyser" to meet many research pre-reqs but it does not need to be attached to a bench.  Oh and it needs a HUMAN Brain to be Built!!! 
* Imperial Manufacture Cogitator is a new device that functions the same as the Toot Cabinet, attaching this to the Imperial ONLY work benches (Fabricator, Weapon Fabricator, Armor Fabircator) you get a large boost to manufacture speed. Oh and it needs a HUMAN Brain to be Built!!! NOTE: I could extend these to Vanilla benches but not sure if i should.
* Added the Ability to Harvest Brains as these are a NEW Resource "Brain In a Jar" Item!. Prisoners are a great resource now, or one of your own pawns you dont like :) 
* Changed a pile of "WorkToMake" tags to "WorkToBuild" so correct pawn skill and work prioritisation is used. I think this little change could make a big difference as many items were labled to but MADE rather than BUILT.
* Reduced the work to make on many of the high end items like fabricators, planetary extractor etc.
* Reworked Floor Art so that it can be built upon, so now you can have then under items like beds tables etc.
* Reworked the Metal Floor Art Items (Aquailla) 5x5 & 3x3 to fit better shold look better and bit better around your base.
* New Imperial DropPod, so these are the same as the vanilla transport pod in function, but have far more hitpoints, can be built quicker and reasonably cheap to build once researched. Can be used with Vanilla Lancher or New Imperial Launcher.
* New Imperial DropPod Launcher, so these are same as vanilla launcher in function, but far more hitpoints and three times the fuel capacity using Raw Promethium fuel. Built quickly and with lowish resource, need to be researched.

* Case Sensitive change on loads of Defs, from  a capital to lowercase e.g. <Fertility>0</Fertility> to <fertility>0</fertility> --> Likely from my original sloppyness.
* <WorkToMake>100</WorkToMake> changed to <WorkToBuild>100</WorkToBuild> in Floors

V1.516
* Updated work priorities on the Imperial fabricators to make pawn do them over some more mundance tasks.
