#SHORT DESCRIPTION#
WH40k Astra Militarium Imperial Guard Mod, is a core mod to add the Imperial Guard to RimWorld. Why the imperial Guard over the Astartes well for me they fit better into the universe, and are still puny humans that Rimworld can punish... For the Emperor! 

#LONG DESCRIPTION#
This mod is going to be a core mod for what I hope will be a series of addon Mods for Astra Militarium, at the moment the following has been deployed into this Mod: 

Ranged Weapons - Las Pistol, LasGun, Exitus Sniper Rifle, BotGun, Plasma Rifle and Krak Grenades. 
Armor - The standard Pattern Imperial Armor with helmet for all body types. 
Production - Full production integration with dedicated work benches, and new mineable materials in the form of Ceramite and Adamantium. Also all Weapons can be recycled back into parts with a slight loss so you can reclaim resources from rubbish builds. 
Architecture - Currently there are custom floor textures, doors and beds that will spruce up that interior to bring honour to the Emperor. 
Research - There is a full customised research tree to all of the above.
