Adds expensive heavy reinforced walls with exceptional hit points that resists explosive damage. 

Additionally, you get an embrasure version of the heavy reinforced wall (you can shoot through it, but not walk through it) providing 75% cover from fire. 

Works with all stone and metal materials (even modded.)

Research one industrial project to gain access. Add to a save just fine. Remove it from a save easy too, just remove the walls first.
