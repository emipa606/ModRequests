# RimWorld-PrayerSpot

Place one or more prayer spots in your colony to direct pawns where to pray.
        
Pawns will, when they pray, pick a prayer spot instead of only going to their room (they will sometimes still go to their room.)
        
Note:  This mod does not add any prayer buildings of any sort.  However, if you have shrines/etc from other mods, this should allow you to specify where the pawns pray.
        
Uses:
 * Make pews for your church!
 * Pray at family shrines in your room!  (I think some japanese-themed mods add them as basic furniture?)
 * You can put prayer spots *anywhere*.  Don't be stupid.
 * * (except on geothermal vents - haven't figured that out yet)
 * Hey, if you want your faithful going into the ocean to worship Dagan, this mod lets you do it!

Future plans:
 * Meditation Spots
 * Allow meditating and praying in any spot
 * "temple"/"chapel"/"better name?" room designation
 * Mood boost from praying/meditating in a nice area
 * Mod Option to delete all prayer spots on the map (in case you lost a few under mountains or something?)
 * Mod Options to turn off any functionality? (probably via HugsLib)
 * * Disallow praying in rooms, so everyone goes to church to pray!

Thanks to TOGFox for some initial work (which wasn't used in the end) and for some initial prodding (which was very useful) and support.
