    <description>Extract an animal hemogen pack from the target animal. Animal hemogen packs are less effective than human ones, but are often seen as more acceptable. The operation will fail to produce an animal hemogen pack if the target does not have enough blood.\n\nAnimal hemogen packs can be administered to others to reduce blood loss or to satiate those who feed on blood.</description>
