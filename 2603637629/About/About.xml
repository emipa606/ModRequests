	V1.1:
	updated to 1.4
	
	V1.0 - This mod:
	Makes the Spikecore Style of the Parka/ Jacket/ Duster Actually look like metal spikes.
	However, currently spikecore flackjackets have a chance to be crafted in white, this does not affect pirates with spikecore flakjackets, only crafted ones???
	Added a 20% transparency to Burkas and animalStyle Cataphract Helmets.
	
	All Textures have been upscaled with some exceptions that were already a high ennough texture.
	The improvements also include the different styles for everything such as the tables.
	Textures that have improved include:
	Clothing / Tattoos / Dryads
	Buildings / ArtSlabs / Sculptures
	Plants / Ruins / Relics
	
	Feel free to use my textures if you were wanting to use ideology textures for a mod project!
