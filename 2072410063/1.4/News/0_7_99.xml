    <content>New: 
    - paths now slowly get wider with lots of use. You can toggle this behaviour in the mod options, and also tweak the speed at which paths get wider.
    - modders can now change the type of paths created for different terrains, or toggle desire paths off for specific terrains altogether.
    |Fixed:
    - packed dirt paths no longer appear on ice sheets.</content>
