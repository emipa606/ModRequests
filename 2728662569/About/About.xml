    <description>Tweaks some stuff in the Androids mod. Listed below.

Vanometric Cell no longer negates food, just energy.  You still don't need food, so your pawn will actively eat if they're not told not to.  I like this better 'cause it means they'll get mood buffs from good food. I also changed the cost to require an actual vanometric cell, or a small one if you have X installed.

The Archotech upgrade changed to a 50% increase in consciousness and mental break threshold. The original buff seemed lackluster and had no downsides, despite saying it was "dangerous;" 50% consciousness is not lackluster, and 50% mental break increase is very dangerous. Keep you Archotechs happy people! (Might change this; 50% is a lot of consciousness)

Might add more as I keep playing.

Mid game install is fine, but not all changes will affect existing pawns.</description>
