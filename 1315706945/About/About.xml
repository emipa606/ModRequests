<description>Pawns in different towns (or maps as the game refers to them) no longer know about organ harvestings or executions, one might say they are unaware of what transpires behind closed doors.

I basically stole everything from Smart Medicine by Uuugggg, and plugged in my relevent info. Thanks to him, the folks at harmony, which is mostly pardeike, and to Tynan, the absolute madman.

Fair warning, I have no idea what I'm doing. Let me know if you have any issues. Furthermore, if you know what you're doing and have some free time, feel free to investigate the mod and tell me all the things I did wrong.
