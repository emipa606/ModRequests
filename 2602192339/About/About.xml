   <name>High Density Hydroponics Realism Patch</name>
<description>This mod rebalances the High Density Hydroponics mod by Yumemirareru so that the costs are more inline with vanilla hydroponics basins and sun lamps.  Now rather than not only being a cheaper per plant option, it is roughly equivalent to the base game, with a little more high end materials to glue it all together.  It also increases power requirements and time to build to match, with a buff to HP to make your now quite large investment a bit less likely to break.</description>
