    <description>Ever wondered how tech in Rimworld brings about advanced bionics and spaceflight, but no gaming computers?
	
Well, that's about to change!*

*(after you have microelectronics researched)
	
This mod adds a new way for your colonists to get some fun in their day; a sweet gaming desktop rig. Play the hottest game around!

The gaming desktop provides a brand new recreation type (computer gaming) and a rapid way to refill their joy.
