  <description>NOTE:This mod is made for RBSE, so you must load this mod after RBSE. Also, never load this mod with the original the Birds and the Bees mod, it will cause errors.
  
 This mod adds reproductive organs to the animals, and then you, raiders and time can take them away again. 
  
 This mod is similar to the original The Birds and the Bees mod, but I rebalanced bionic reproductive organs for RBSE. Now you can make bionic reproductive organs on the bionic table that added by RBSE. Also, making bionic reproduction organs now uses fewer materials (and I lowered the market value of it). 
  
 There is an advanced version of bionic reproductive organs. It has a greater fertality and makes the wearer feel good.
