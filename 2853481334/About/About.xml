  <description>Berry Sorbet to cool you off.
  
Version 1.0

Made at an electric stove, using only corn for its syrup and berries, you can now craft Berry Sorbet.

Increases maximum and minimum comfy temperature for those hot days.
Gives a sweet and tasty treat +4 mood buff.

Idea by Kinetic Kimo and made as a stand alone MOD from my full Ice Cream MOD.
