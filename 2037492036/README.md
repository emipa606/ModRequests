## ==== Early Work In Progress Rebuild Release 

# Project RimFactory - Insanity
This sub mod of PRF was originally made by spdskatr and is made on idea of equivalent exchange.
Mod never really gain potential popularity because it to, many ppl felt strange and misplaced with paperclips.

I Will try remake this mod in a new fashion where i feel it would be a more fun story to it.
It will now be based still around equivalent exchange, but take inspiration more of equivalent exchange 2 / project e, and similar mods from minecraft and other games with such mods.

First Paperclips will be scrapped and changed with a new currency EMC(energy matter covalence)
which is related to Einsteins e=mc2.

## Focus
Mod will be considered more OverPowered, and to Magic side than PRF - Core is.
It will be based around:
- Equivalent Exchange
- Alchemy
- Crazy Sciencetist

And is meant to be a lategame addition to Core.
This is a flavor mod and may not fit in every playthrough.
