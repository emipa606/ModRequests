Go ahed, craft Archorace Egg, its cost 400 fragments, need 20 lvl crafter and need protection until it hatch. But you got green thing with no need to wait until quest occur, you need to convert and recruet youngling, due rebelios nature of the kids (i like to pretend its feature, not my incompetents) Mod maked for fun, special thanks to smith589, whom code i scrapt.
