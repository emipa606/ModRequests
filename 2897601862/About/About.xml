	<description>&lt;size=18&gt;&lt;color=#66C0F4&gt;About&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/size&gt;
  
    Alters the way slaves are counted for raid strength and wealth calculations. This makes it easier to have slave-focused colonies. Additionally, this mod makes it so the game treats colonists and slaves inside of biosculpting pods the same way it treats pawns inside a crytosleep casket.

&lt;size=18&gt;&lt;color=#66C0F4&gt;Settings&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/size&gt;

    Vanilla calculation for raid strength adds all the wealth together, then fits it to a curve to convert it into raid points. Then it takes all colonists and adds more points per colonist. Then it adds more points for all combat-capable animals. In vanilla slaves are treated as 70% normal colonist for these additional raid points, and 75% of a colonist for wealth.

&lt;b&gt;Slaves are furniture&lt;/b&gt;:
    Treat slaves as objects. Wealth from slaves is decreased to 50%, and slaves add no additional raid points. (Recommended for non-combat slaves)

&lt;b&gt;Slaves are animals&lt;/b&gt;:
    Treat slaves as combat-capable animals. Wealth from slaves is increased to 100%, and slaves add additional raid points based on 8% of their combat value. (Recommended for slave armies)

&lt;b&gt;Slaves are prisoners&lt;/b&gt;:
    Treat slaves as prisoners. Slaves have no effect on wealth or raid points.

&lt;size=18&gt;&lt;color=#66C0F4&gt;Integration&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/size&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Combat Readiness Check&lt;/b&gt;:
    When used with CRC this mod will use the values in CRC’s settings for furniture wealth percent and animal combat percent. Additionally, this treats colony mechs as thrice as effective as animals. Any changes made to CRC’s settings require a game restart to effect this mod.

&lt;b&gt;Prepare for Combat&lt;/b&gt;:
    Replaces the above settings with sliders for slave wealth percent and slave raid point percent.
