    <description>Adds a race of humanoid Deathclaws, dubbed "Deathcloids", and appropriate tribal factions. Deathcloids have natural armor and weapons in the form of their claws and hides. They are simple-minded compared to humans, and struggle with social and mental tasks. As well, their claws make tasks that require careful manipulation with their hands quite difficult.

If you're reading this part of the description, that means you're currently playtesting the mod! The mod is essentially playable, but there are some notable things that will need to be added.
Such as, custom naming rules for pawns and factions, deathclaw variants (matriach, alpha male, etc, etc), and some... special.. clothing option (coughbikinicough).
But for now, I'm just concered with the baseline feel and balance of it all before I start adding extra fluff. So, have fun in your "wild" wasteland. ;)</description>
