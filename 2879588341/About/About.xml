  <description>You're trying to build an industrial hub, a beacon of civilization on the Rim, and what do you get for colonists?
  
  That's right, people who barely know how to tie their shoes.  (Assuming they even *have* shoes...)
  
  Now you have a solution to this problem - an all-in-one training system designed to take those barely-verbal primitives all the way to planet-reknowned masters.*
