[h1]Framework Description[/h1]
Colonists can be categorized into three types: ALIVE, DEAD, or UNKNOWN. Those that are walking around are ALIVE (unless you are using some necromancy mods, those I don't plan to support yet); those that are dead are DEAD, and everyone else (e.g. kidnapped, or went on a caravan that lasts a long time but still alive) are UNKNOWN.

A new WorldComponent is used to store those three states, along with some rough information that is sufficient to deduce e.g. for how long did the pawn went missing.

The features of this framework is arguably similar to what Desynchronized: Tales and News eventually settled at before it was abandoned and neglected, but this framework are made to be more abstract and general-purpose.
