# TODO:

+ Item Translocator building (slowly pulls items around the map to the DSU)
+ Option that forbids items only in DSU, but allows it from Access Point
+ DSU power efficiency technology
+ DSU heating efficiency technology (how to disable in the runtime?)
+ Setting: pathfinding/distance only from Access Point to Bill Giver
+ Dedicated textures for each port
+ Output Bus: respects `Building_Storage` settings
+ Output Bus: deny to place to non `Building_Storage` building
+ Output Bus: red mark (instead yellow) if can't place there
+ Output Bus: forbid output
+ Output Bus: Alert about non-zoned output if not forbidden
+ Output Bus: Patch "allow all" if the item was "spawned" by the port?
+ Bill radius fix: correct radius from large buildings
