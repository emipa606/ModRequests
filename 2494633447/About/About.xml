This Patch adds extra ears to human pawns when using [NL] Facial Animation - WIP. So you can see if a pawn looses an ear (and you can remove ears of pawns if you'd like to...).

For an existing savegame you have load the textures of you pawn again. For example with Character Editor you can randomize the appearence of your pawn and set it back as it was.

This patch is compatible with my other patches for the Astoriel and Orassan.

Unfortunately every alien race which has set "Human Race" as parent race inherits these ears (for example the races Revia and Hisa). If you use them together with this patch they'll have human ears AND their own ears.
