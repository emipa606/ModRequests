  <description>Bio-Tech content mod.

This mod will make Gene Coma Tendable, and upon tending, the recovery will be Severely accelerated.
Better quality tending will make the recovery accelerated even further.
100% Tending quality = Recover in 2 Days. (BY DEFAULT)

You can change the recovery speed by going into the ModSettings inside XML's menu (or "More Mod Settings") and change it from there.

It may seem like its not working because there is no timer but Don't worry, The fact that there is no timer means that it is working! You can see it through Debug mode.</description>
