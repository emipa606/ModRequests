To replace the vanilla IEDs / Mines textures, simply copy the Textures folder from here and paste it / overwrite the main Textures folder (the one where the About and Textures folders are).
To revert to normal size textures, simply unsubscribe and resubscribe / redownload this mod. These alternate textures are 33% smaller and should modify only the vanilla IEDs / Mines.
