    This is a continuation of the "[T] MoreBedsCloth" mod by Telkir. Spruce up your colonists' bedrooms with a selection of different colors for all sizes of beds.

    Features:
    - Beds of all sizes now have red, yellow, green, blue, and purple variants.
    - Beds now require an amount of cloth to build - the bigger or grander the bed, the more cloth is needed.
    Note: New beds added by this mod do not recolor when set to prisoner or medical use.

    Original Mod by Telkir.
