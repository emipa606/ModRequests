      |The 'create blueprint from selection' button has been renamed to 'Copy', and now creates a temporary blueprint by default. This means you can quickly copy-paste selected objects and rooms without creating new blueprints. You can also use the new keybinding configurable in the mod options (default: Ctrl+C).
      |If you want to create a permanent blueprint, you can right-click the 'Copy' button when you have a room selected, or use the 'Create Blueprint' designator in the Blueprints tab of the architect.
