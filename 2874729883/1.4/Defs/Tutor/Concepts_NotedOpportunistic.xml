        <helpText>Colonists will automatically use any tools that they're capable of using from their main hand and their inventory, and will only use the best tools that they have for certain work tasks. Any tools that a colonist is currently using will be marked as 'in use'.</helpText>

        <helpText>As colonists use tools that are either in their inventory or main hand, those tools will degrade over use and eventually break.\n\nYou can see how much continous use a tool can take before breaking by viewing its info card, though the readout doesn't factor in the tool's current condition.</helpText>
