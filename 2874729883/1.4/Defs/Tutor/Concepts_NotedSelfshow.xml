        <priority>30</priority>
        <helpText>In order for colonists to be able to perform certain tasks (e.g. felling trees) efficiently, they need to have the appropriate tools (e.g. axes for felling trees).\n\nSelect a colonist, right-click a tool you want them to use, then either have them equip it in their main hand or put it in their inventory.\n\nColonists can only carry up to 2 tools at once in their inventory, so keep that in mind! Tool belts can be created at tailoring benches which increases this number by 2 when worn.</helpText>
