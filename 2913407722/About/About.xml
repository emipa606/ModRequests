	[h1]The issue with the option menu not working has been fixed. [/h1]

[b]This mod introduces a health levelling system. Start as a Level 0 Colonist and work your way up to the doomsday launcher absorbing Level 100 Pirate Boss![/b]

[b[Added: No longer effective on pawns that are not the player so end game modded factions don't become invulnerable bullet sponges while you're trying to kill them if your settings have a low leveling threshold[/b]

I'm happy to delete this file if the original mod author updates theirs and requests this one taken down.
