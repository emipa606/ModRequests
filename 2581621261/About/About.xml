Adds a smaller, weaker, version of the monosword for use as a secondary weapon.
That's it.

Slightly over half the stats as the full sword.
Should be vanilla friendly, but requires defs from Royalty.
Same Empire/Ultratech settings.

Can be manufactured after techprint and research.

Ideal for colonists/ideologies that don't like low-tech weapons.


Created with Simple Sidearms mod in mind, but it's not required.
