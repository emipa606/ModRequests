	<Natural_desc>Natural organs are not difficult to get. A couple of headshots, work with a knife and you're done - my organ.</Natural_desc>
	<Simple_desc>Simple prostheses are not popular, but getting them is very easy. We are looking for some tramp, cut him down and our prosthesis.</Simple_desc>
	<Bionic_desc>Bionic prostheses are very valuable. They are popular with the rich, so getting them is quite difficult. These kind of people always have security, and they themselves, to be honest, can pile on anyone or run away from you at the speed of a cheetah.</Bionic_desc>
	<Archotech_desc>Yes, I heard about these prostheses. Incredibly valuable prey. Finding her is incredibly difficult. The owners of such gizmos have such protection that they can be taken by assault of the planet, because of this it is very difficult to get them out of them without destroying them. But if the client offers a sufficient amount, I will get it.</Archotech_desc>
	<Improved_desc>General-purpose prostheses are found in absolutely everyone in the galaxy. Here, how lucky.</Improved_desc>
	<Implant_desc>Do you want to pump your brain? Implants are rare, and it’s difficult to detect them, and pulling out without damaging is even more difficult. However, I have experience working with them.</Implant_desc>

	<EmailMessage_Eisenberg_Text>Listen, I haven’t been working with you for so long, but I see that you are an intelligent guy. On this planet, I had a laboratory in which I was engaged ... so to speak, not entirely in creating only drugs. Yesterday I received a notification from the security systems. One of its main blocks is disconnected, which leads to the risk of release by what is located there. You need to come to the laboratory and turn on backup protection systems. It’s a dangerous business, but everything you find there is yours, well, I’ll throw silver on top.</EmailMessage_Eisenberg_Text>

There are many drugs left inside, maybe they will help you.

Inside the laboratory, the walls and doors are protected by an electric field, so you will need to destroy the generator rooms first. Beware of the living creatures inside.

Good luck</Quest_Laboratory_Info1>
