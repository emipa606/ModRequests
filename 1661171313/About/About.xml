Robots for Callistan users. 
Requires the Android and Callistan mods.

Protobot: used for basic base building and cleaning, unable to fight
Destructobot: used for combat purposes, its a tanky fighter
Constructobot: used for more advanced building/ manufacturing
Civibot: a useful member of the colony, able to function as a colonist
Murderbot: a more specialized shooter, takes less punishment than the Destructobot
Domestibot: able to perform more complex chores than the protobot
Escortbot: designed for companionship. Rumors of these models going berserk and killing patrons are highly exhaggerated.
