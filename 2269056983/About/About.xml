Frost and Fire by Rhadamant
https://rhadamant.com/frostandfire


Frost and Fire is a Kenshi inspired RimWorld full conversion mod. The mod is intended to be played as an ultimate survival scenario, which will be extremely difficult and radically changes traditional tactics and strategies. This project is a result of the Rhadamant Plays community proposing an extreme temperature challenge, and that proposal won in a public poll by popular vote. The mod is intended to be played with the associated scenario for maximum challenge and balance, and ideally, the accompanying save game file so that everyone starts on equal footing. The rest of the information provided here may be considered spoilers, so if you wish to try Frost and Fire as a blind attempt, please read no further than the installation guide, scenario and community challenge.
