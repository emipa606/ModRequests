Hey there!

Drop this folder into your RimWorld/Mods/ folder.

You'll also need the Frost and Fire scenario at the very least to make the mod work properly.

The scenarios can be found on Steam Workshop or at https://rhadamant.com/frostandfire/

The save game files are encouraged for you all to use as well, also supplied at https://rhadamant.com/frostandfire/

If you don't use the save game file there are some instructions you ought to follow on the website as well.

Good luck!
