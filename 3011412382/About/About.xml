This mod gives random chances to all sorts of things including but not limited to the possibilty of getting jade or gold from stonecutting instead of stone blocks and horribly ineffective cooks burning themselves at the stove.

        CHECK RANDOM CHANCE VALUES BEFORE RELEASE

        - equipping and unequipping power armors could come with a risk of pawns getting stuck in an inconvenient way
        - low level pawns with no passion in skill for required task
            - X cancels job: got bored, having a beer
        - poorly made art
            - pawns have chance to insult the artist, start social fights
        - [DONE] cooking, pawns cut fingers (off?) with poor level
        - [DONE] cooking, pawns with high level can get a bonus meal or one of the next quality up
        - [DONE] cooking, pawns with low level can accidentally set the stove (and a surrounding tile or two) on fire
        - hauling, pawn lifted with their back, not their knees (hook into Verse.Pawn_CarryTracker.TryStartCarry)
        - [DONE] butchering, pawn with poor skill gets blood and filth everywhere
        - cleaning, pawn accidentally spreads the filth instead
        - "horse shoe pins could probably be a bit more dangerous too"
            - dart boards too
        - [DONE] animals, pawns can get rammed or kicked, or worse by animals while milking, sheering, or anything else
