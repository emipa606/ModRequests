	<description>Adds a teleport bench and its tiles to stand on.

Buildings:
- Teleport workstation : at least one is needed. It will give orders to tp spots.
- Mini station : smaller workstation, with smaller capacities.
- Teleport spot : build it close to the workstation and choose the way it works. It is also a storage, meaning you can prioritize what pawns will put on it. You can choose to automate teleportation and the way it goes : in, out, swap.
- Teleport catcher : cheap wooden building that you can link to a teleport spot. It is a storage. A pawn or any object standing on it will be teleported.
- Teleport bed : cheap building that allows to teleport wounded, incapacitated or captured pawns.
- Teleport box : did you think we would leave the cat behind?

Howto :
- Build tp workstation (power required)
- Build tp spot in workstation range (power required)
- Build tp catcher
- Link the tp spot to the tp catcher with a colonist
- Select tp spot, choose the way the spot teleports.
- Select workstation to start it up. You can browse different tp spots within range.
- Cast teleportation with workstation. Alternatively, you can choose to teleport automatically.

Travel between maps:
- Link the spots before you travel.
- Uninstall the spot that does not require power.
- Carry the spot in caravan.
- Reinstall.
- ???
- Profit.
