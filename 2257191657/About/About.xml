	<description>This is a mod by request of someone on the Ludeon forums. This mod adds in two new Pacifist traits, reworked so that they have both positive and negative traits.

	The Pacifists refuse to do violent work, including shooting, melee, and hunting.

	Pacifist (Medic) has an initial +4 skill bonus to doctoring, with increased medical tend offset and a slight social bonus.
	Pacifist (Scientist) has an initial +4 skill bonus to intellectual, with a -2 to social and terrible social interaction skills. However, his base research speed is 140% compared to normal.
