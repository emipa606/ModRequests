  <description>Easily create and update your pawn outfits with the click of a button.

Usage: When you force a pawn to wear apparel, a new save button appears between Clr. forced and Edit.

Left click: Create a new outfit policy with the name of the selected pawn, with only the currently worn apparel allowed. Forced wear is then released.

Right click: Update current policy with forced items. All existing items remain allowed by the policy, even if they're not currently worn.
