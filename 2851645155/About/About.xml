Finishing Touches By The Best Builder 1.4

- About this mod -
With this mod enabled, only those who are automatically selected (by default, simply the settlers with the most building skills) can be assigned to finish the building work.
Other settlers cannot do the finishing touches, but they can still be involved in the building process up to that point.

- How to use -
Click on the icon in the lower right corner of the screen to open the settings screen.
There you can activate MODs, set conditions for the selection of qualified architectural finishers, etc.

- Specifications -
Only buildings with quality will be affected by this mod.
Also, if you give manual building instructions, anyone will ignore this mod's control and work up to the building finish without restrictions.
The mod itself can be safely added or removed from the game in the process.

- Incompatible -
QualityBuilder: No errors are generated, but the specifications do not mesh well with each other, resulting in bugs that prevent the completion of construction.

- Special Thanks -
