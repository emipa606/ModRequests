    <description>Vanilla Textures Expanded - Save Our Ship 2 is a full-scale overhaul of Save Our Ship 2 textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring the overall aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.

This texture pack includes over 150 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.

When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - in some cases we did take artistic liberties to change things to fit RimWorld universe better.
