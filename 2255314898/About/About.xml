	<description>Boomrats now yield chemfuel, like their bigger boomalope brethren! 3 chemfuel per 2 days. Details, rationale, and math on the workshop page! If that sounds like an awful small amount... it is. I mean, I want it balanced around boomalopes too - boomrats shouldn't be clearly better. Anyway, again, check out the Steam workshop page for my extensive rationale. OR download my other mod: BoomChem Takes Time! It increases chemfuel batch sizes, while also increasing the time between milkings so as to maintain balance. Load BCTT after this mod if you try it - and remember, you need this one if you want boomrat chem. BCTT doesn't add boomrat milking, just alters it in parallel with the boomalope changes if this mod (or another one, I guess) adds boomrat milking. For compatibility.</description>
