  <description>Remember the basics of CQC. Non-lethal takedown of an opponent.
  
NOTE: Pawns need to be at least 8 melee to perform a CQC knock-out

WARNING:
- Mod is highly unbalanced. This mod has no chance of being polished in terms of balancing because of coding limitations.
- Using the ability towards allies will cause zero reactions from them, another coding limitation issue that may be left unfixed.
