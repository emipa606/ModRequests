  &#40;Updated to 1.3 - it always worked for 1.0+, but now won't be marked as outdated. I'll likely not add fine carpet and straw as I am working on a new texture set.&#41;
  
  Old Gods is intended to be a series of mods to make Rimworld a bit darker. 
  The series is a work in progress to be released in themed batches. Terrain is the first in the series of textures. 
  
  All textures were created by the author(ApocalypsePal) and should not be separated from this mod.
  
  This set of textures modifies the base terrain textures.
  Asphalt, Carpet, Concrete, Flagstone, Floortile, Gravel, Ice, Marsh, Marshy Soil, Mossy, Mud, Packed Dirt, Rocks, Soils, Tiled Stone, Water, Wood
