	<description>Event Scheduler allows you to use Dev mode to schedule events in your game!

This is a great tool for making custom scenarios to fit your play style. its also one of the tools we have used to make our challenge series.

When adding events to the Queue you can select the time and date the events will occur, These get added to the storytellers event queue. And don't worry if you change storytellers the event queue doesn't change! So your events will still occur. this is safe to add or remove from any save at any time. all scheduled events will still occur without the mod installed.</description>
