  <description>A mod that has heavy shells from, now removed from the workshop, WD-Expanded Artillery by Wemd and allow them to be loaded into the Artillery from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security. \n\nNow that Wemd has removed their mod, Expanded Artillery, from the Steam workshop, this mod now contains only the shells that were in that mod because I feel like mortars selection from vanilla and other mods are already saturated enough. \n\nIf Wemd ever wanted this mod removed, It will be so.</description>
