	<description>This mod adds two types of flooring to fill your vaults and properly display the honestly unhealthy amounts of wealth you have been hoarding. 
Psychologists discourage the distribution of these to dragons, or affiliated xenotypes.
In addition to adding these oh so exuberantly expensive floors this mod also addresses the horrible disservice done to the vanilla gold colour and adjusts it to match the alluring warmth and lustre we all desire.
Last but not least, metal floor-tiles have been adjusted to practically shine with the glamour of the newly introduced golden splendour.</description>
