		<content>| WARNING || Adding this mod along with LWM DeepStorage to an ongoing save file will cause issues with any Ancient Storage Buildings already on the map. || It is NOT reccomended to add this mod to a save that currently also uses LWM Deep Storage. ||  Alternatively, you can use DevMode->Destroy on all Ancient Storage Buildings first, save, then add Scrap Collector. You can then re-add them if you wish and they should function properly. | I have contacted LWM about this and will explore solutions if there are any.</content>
