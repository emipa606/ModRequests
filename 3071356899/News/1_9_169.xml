New:
| Backup control units now have a toggle for running on batteries, which affects when backup generators turn off. 
| If enabled, backup generators turn off when:
- there are batteries connected to the network, and those batteries have sufficient charge. 
| If disabled, backup generators only turn off when:
- power production will be higher than consumption after turning off this generator
- if there are batteries connected, they are sufficiently charged.
| This behaviour is enabled by default, and can be toggled for each generator.
||Tweaks:
| The research prerquisite for backup control units has been changed from microelectronics to electronics, and its' research cost has been decreased to 400. This brings it more in line with vanilla batteries research, which is arguably around the same tech level.
