add control units to generators to automatically switch them on and off when needed

![Features](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Features.png)  
Adds generator control boxes, which will automatically turn the generators they are attached to on and off depending on current power levels.  
![Power Control Box](https://i.imgur.com/kQtPswV.gif)

Control boxes can be built after researching _Backup Power_, a follow-up to _Microelectronics_. Once researched, build a power control box on top of any generator to have it automatically toggled on/off depending on the electrical grid's supply and demand.  

Should work on any power generator that has the 'flickable' tag, so any vanilla or modded power producer that can be toggled on and off.

Control boxes have an indicator light that can take three colours:  
 - blue: control box is in standby, the generator is not currently needed.
 - green: control box is active, the generator is running.
 - red: control box error, the generator can not run.

Normally, this is where I ask you to show you appreciation by buying me a coffee.

These are not normal times. Ukraine is being invaded by Russia, at the whim of a ruthless dictator. Innocent people are loosing their lives, and fighting for their continued freedom.

This is not a matter of politics. This is not a debate. Putins' bloody campaign in Ukraine is illegal, and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants, when he wants it, no matter the cost. The Russian army is invading a country without provocation, bombing civilians and murdering innocents.

The prospect of waking up to see my country at war is alien to me, as it must have seemed to most Ukrainians. I can do little to influence the outcome of current affairs, but I will do whatever I can.

**I ask you to join me in supporting the people of Ukraine**

If you can, donate to the various charities providing humanitarian aid. If you don't know where to donate, Global Citizen maintains a list of charitable organizations active in the region.

![Speak up](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Speak%20up.png)  

Leaders around the world are deciding on how to respond to Putins' aggression. They are balancing their conscience, and their desire to be re-elected. Many are afraid to impose heavy sanctions because the economic repercussions might loose them votes. The Dutch government, my government, has hinted that they are unwilling to accept Ukranian refugees, and has played a part in allowing Russia to have continued access to international finance. I am ashamed of these actions, taken in my name.

Whereever your live, please let your government know you care more about supporting the people of Ukraine than you do about the price of gas. Join a protest, write letters, call your representatives, and show them that you care about justice!
