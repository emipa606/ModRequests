	<description>This basic mod allows you to have more colonist than vanilla. 
	
	NOW there is NO MORE POPULATION LIMIT! and you always get colonists from different events/sources. 
	
	It's not like you always get colonists every time. It's about limiting your popcurve. 
	
	Basically when you reach 7~9 colonists, there is no way to buy SLAVES!
