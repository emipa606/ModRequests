  <description>Simple Pallet
  
Version 1.1

A rotatable Pallet you can make out of lots of different stuff.

Since it keeps things off the ground it helps with deterioration outdoors.

Since they usually hold ugly stuff it helps with ignoring the beauty of whats on it.

Compatibility - Should be completely.

Version 1.0 - Release
Version 1.1 - Added 0 value for beauty and updated graphic to show the floor below like a normal pallet would.
