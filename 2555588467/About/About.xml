<description>Adds a varied collection of tattoos to the game, some rather eccentric, some more easy to cover up.

Tattoos have been put into different categories e.g, Tribal, Punk, Cannibal etc. So you may not neccesarily encounter them all in a single playthrough. When starting a new run with Ideology, you can manually enable all of these tattoos within your colony if you like.
Enjoy!
