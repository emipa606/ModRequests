Adds dozens of NPC encounters aimed at low-to-mid strength player ships that can be scanned down normally. These vessels will not be directly aggressive to you, as their trials and motivations are far removed from yours. From navy defectors to anti-Imperial insurgents, the Rim is a first-class destination for those escaping Imperial justice. You will cross paths with these stateless peoples looking for survival - how you deal with them is up to you.

"Deserters! Traitors! Conspirators! All manner of filth flock to the Rim in piteous attempts to escape justice. A wary traveller would do well to stay armed and alert in these difficult times, because they are surrounded by those who would harm them. From anti-ship weapons fire to poisonous lies, space is filled with the worst of humanity every day. The assorted rabble you come across may not be immediately hostile to you and your brave crew, but nonetheless, they are vicious enemies of the Empire."
