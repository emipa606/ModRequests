  <description>[h1]This is a Judge Dredd Armory Mod.[/h1]
  
  [h2]This mod only contains weapons and apparel. No Factions included.[/h2]
  It is this way since most of the weapons has toggable weapons and the AI doesn't know how to toggle them, making it a terrible unbalanced faction.
  
  [h2]What this mods include:[/2]
  7 Apparels: Judge Garb, Chief Justice Garb, Judge Armor, Senior Judge Armor, Judge Helmn, Judge Hunter Helm, Judge Hunter Armor
  4 Apparel Accessories: Judge Belt, Judge Hunter Belt (Shield Belts), Judge Gloves, Judge Boots(has a knife attached)
  5 Weappns: Lawgiver MKII, SpitCarbine, Arbitrator, Puzzle Gun, Daystick
  1 Resource: Ballistic Fiber
  
  Most of these are locked behind [Advanced Fabrication] Research and requires the Fabrication Workbench. These are Spacer tech items other than the Daystick.
  
  [h2]I will not make a CE patch, though if someone makes one. That's good to hear.[/h2]
