This fork just changes the chances for mortality to be applied so that pawns will die younger. The chance to get mortality starts at age 50, and increases exponentially. Most pawn will get mortaility between 60-75. Also, this fork adds the chance for long-lived pawns, as after 90 years old, the chance for mortality to be applied is reduced somewhat, and stays constant. This is rare though, so you probably will not see it unless you have a signifigant amount of pawns.


[ORIGINAL MOD PAGE DESCRIPTION]
This mod adds a mortality system to the Game. Every birthday after the 60est has a increasing chance to apply “Mortality”. Once received the colonist will die after 10 ingame days. You can prolong your colonists life by treating him/her with a “Healer Mech Serum” or a “Bio-Regen Cycle” in the Biosculptor from the Ideology DLC.

Percentages:

Each Birthday:

*60 – 70 = 1%
*70 – 80 = 5%
*80 = 10%

After the 80est birthday the chance increases by 2.5% each year until it hits 50% at the age of 96

Sub mods:
*None right now.

Mod Compatibility:
*No known incompatibilities.
*Please let me know of any conflicting mods and I will do my best to support them.
