	<description>This mod patches Vanilla Psycasts Expanded to add both a Stargate focus type and meditation stats to the Stargate, Advanced Stargate, and Makeshift Stargate. Now your pawns can meditate in front of the Stargate aka Chappa'ai aka Circle of Standing Water aka Ring of the Ancestors aka Wraith Well etc.

Make sure to place your meditation spots in the red highlighted area right in front of the stargate; that's where all the top tier psychic energy likes to coalesce!

Feel free to yoink these patches if you want to make your own meditation structures and focus types. Get weird with it, why don't you?

Big thanks to the fine folks in Mr Samuel Streamer's discord who helped me get the Stargate to properly link to the Stargate focus type.

Make sure to check out the new Stargate mods by Ranger Rick and the rest of their mod team. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2843729738 I can't wait to see what they've got coming up!
