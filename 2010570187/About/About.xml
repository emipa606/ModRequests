	A man who dies, no matter how terrible his crime was, must be brought to burial.

This mod adds even more elegant memorials to store the bodies of your dead colonists. 
Give them a proper burial the others will never forget! You can research Memorials to make them.
They take stone-like materials (or ores like steel/gold) and give off lots of joy while honoring the occupant.
