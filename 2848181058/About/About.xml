	<description>Changes the texture of the Gallatross from the Alpha Animals mod, I want to thank my mom for birthing me giving me the ability to draw a furry creature from a game about surviving on an inhospitable planet and harvesting organs, the creator of alpha animals for putting me out of the artblock for a sec by making gallatrosses appear on my map, and ofc, God, for creating everything, including rimworld.</description>
