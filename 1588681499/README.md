I have updated this mod further for RimWorld, upon seeing that Ludeon user "Caffeine Zombie" took the first and largest step to updating. A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals. Horns, pack animals, and Thrumbo upgrades.
 
My Credits:
- kaptain_kavern for the original mod.
- ðŸ¦‰ owl for Westerado compatibility
- Ludeon Forum user "Caffeine Zombie" for the original RimWorld v1.0 update
- EagleCall for GitHub edits.

Original Mod Author's Thanks/Credits:
- A big Thank you to Oblitus : For fixing "pack animals" to be buyable
- Most Horns/Antlers graphics were made by Coercion originally for the TropiCKAPP Rainforest mod
- Also Mehni for pointing me to an error with the changes I made with cats behavior changes
