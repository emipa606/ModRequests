  <description>In the base game, endogenes ('natural genes') may be inherited by offspring while xenogenes ('artificial genes') may not. This mod changes it so that xenogenes can be inherited by offspring, following the same logic as the base game - 50% chance if one parent has the xenogene, 100% chance if both parents have it.

Furthermore, this mod changes the likelihood of inheriting archite genes. In vanilla, inheriting archite genes is impossible. Archite gene inheritance probability is calculated using this formula, one per parent additively: 0.5 * (1.0 / (gene_complexity + 1.0)). That means that one parent with the Ageless gene, which has a complexity of 3, would have a 12.5% chance to pass it on - if both parents have it, there's a 25% chance to pass it on.</description>
