    <description>A patch/addon for Vanilla Cooking Expanded that makes flour and sugarcane production logical, close to how it is or was done in real world, and thus is similar to what existed in RimCuisine. The mod adds production pipelines for wheat and sugarcane stalks: wheat is milled or crushed through quernstones, small electric mills and neolithic smashing spots, and stalks are smashed at neolithic smashing spots and then boiled down to sugar at stoves and campfires. No more picking fallen flour and sugar from soil! The mod also adds young version of wheat and changes idiotic descriptions.</description>
