        <discoveredLetterTitle>Recipe - Skills of the gods</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>Here is what you need at the Drug lab:\n    - 10 Berries ''Liquid base''\n    - 20 Smokeleaves ''To open the mind''\n    - 5 Healroots ''To prevent vomiting''\n    - 100 Neutroamine ''To bind it all together''\n    - 6 Psychoid leaves ''To bring the spirit along for the ride''\n    - 2 Chemfuel ''For that burning Whisky feel''\n\nMix them together and put the distilled form in a bottle.\n\nNext you just find another Any-skill potion and mix in the Catalyst, Done.\n\n\nIt should be noted that, for what ever reason, you don't get a larger portion out of this, such as 2 skill potions. In fact, we got no clue as to where the excess liquid goes. We suspect that the potion is just more condense.</discoveredLetterText>
