	<description>This is a mod that disables the biomes from producing swats of terrain that cannot be constructed on and penalize movement speed. Keep in mind that all biomes are affected, and can, and WILL affect how you play your defensive against raids and offensive in quests. It can also affect your access to certain resources like fishing.</description>
