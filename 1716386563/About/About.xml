	<description>   	My first RimWorld modification. This one incorperates brand
    new blood textures drawn by yours truly to create a better overall
    mess. The textures are messier, having the blood devided into mpre smaller
    dots and splatters than being one big mass like in the default game. This also
    incorperates shading into the textures. While that may not be everyone's
    cup of tea, I believe it makes it much more appealing and unique. I hope
    everyone enjoys and if anyone has any criticism, please state it so I can improve
    this mod.

    Put this in the end of the load order to make sure there are no issues with
    compatability!
