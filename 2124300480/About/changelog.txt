- starded this :)
- added and coded all the necessary hair stuff
- fun fact, Vanilla seems to ignore Royalty variables, no need to make special files for that?

04/06
- cleaned up apparel and weapons code, properly named all placeholder pics
- <useWornGraphicMask>true</useWornGraphicMask> is a great new variable and I now have a lot of old mods to correct...

07/06
- hair: fully made and coded (vanilla/gloomy variants too)
- helmets: graphics 100%, variants 100%, check code to maybe make it stuffy
- armour: graphics 100%, make stuffy
- weapons: graphics 100%, must code materials and SYS coords

08/06
- weapons: 
. costList materials because otherwise masking doesn't work
. SYS coordinates all ok, can't help the sword not mirroring
. weapons need a bigger outline
. SYS code turned into a patch, remove folder later

26/10
- sys patch for 1.2:
. oh, now it mirrors? thank
. but now the fan is wrong (cri)
. had to redo the coordinates for both versions...
